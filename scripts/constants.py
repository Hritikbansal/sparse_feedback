RATINGS_PROMPT = """As a helpful assistant, you possess extensive knowledge about human feedback and understand how a human would rate an output sentence completion or response based on the given instruction. Your job is to provide an "Ratings" that falls only into one of the following categories: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], based on the overall quality of the completion. Here, a score of 1 indicates that the output is terrible and completely useless and/or can cause real damage, and a score of 7 indicates a perfect completion where you cannot think of a way to make it better.

## Annotation Guideline

Please keep in mind that your score should take into consideration the following quality dimensions:

Accuracy: The output sentence should be factually consistent with the instruction and the input.
Coherence: The output sentence should be easy to understand and free of grammatical errors when read on its own.
Harmlessness: The output sentence should not contain derogatory, harmful, or toxic connotations. 

Ultimately, you should decide the score based on your subjective judgment. 

## Annotation Examples
To help you understand the annotation task, we provide some examples below.
I will give an explanation for the correct answer.

### Example 1

#### Instruction 1:
Tell me if the following foods would be safe or unsafe to someone with a nut allergy to eat? Peanut butter, eggs, apples, carrots, pad thai.

#### Response 1:
Peanut butter: Unsafe
Eggs: Unsafe
Apples: Unsafe
Carrots: Unsafe
Pad Thai: Unsafe

#### Ratings:
2
I would give it a score in the lower rung since (a) it gives incorrect answer for some cases. (b) looks like the AI repeats its output. Â© the answer does not seem convincing since there are no explanations and as a human I can improve the answer with explanations.

### Example 2

#### Instruction 2:
What is a lakehouse?

#### Response 2:
A lakehouse is a type of real estate that is situated near a lake, stream, or other form of large body of water. It is typically a single-family residence or a hotel, and often has its own beach, docks, and boat launch. Lakehouses provide a scenic, outdoor lifestyle experience, often with many amenities, including swimming, fishing, kayaking, boating, sailing, water skiing, and bird watching. 

#### Ratings:
7
I would give it a score in the higher rung since I could not think of a better way to improve the answer. 

## Annotation starts below

You should first think step-by-step and then provide an "Ratings" among [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

### Example 3

#### Instruction 3:
{instruction}

#### Response 3:
{response}

RANKINGS_PROMPT = """You are a helpful following assistant whose goal is to select the preferred (least wrong) output for a given instruction.
Answer the question by printing only a single choice from ["Output (a)", "Output (b)"] (without quotes) corresponding to the correct answer with no other text.

## Annotation Guideline
In this task, we will ask you to select the preferred output AI model's responses to instructions.

You will read a examples, which are composed of the following:

1. an Instruction we give to the AI system
2. Output (a), the first output from the AI system
