Second, cash is not subject to the same regulatory and accounting standards that other capital instruments are, making it difficult for banks to value and quantify risks associated with cash holdings. Finally, cash does not offer banks the same forms of security as other capital instruments, such as shares of stock or bonds.

In addition, warmer environments can also have a slower reaction time as a result of its effect on alertness and attention. In warmer climates, it is common to find people dozing off in the afternoon due to this effect.

It is based on the concept of duck typing, a style of programming used to check runtime type safety. Duck typing lets you define your own data types by specifying a particular interface, and you can use programming techniques such as inheritance and composition to create generic code that can interact with all objects that satisfy the given criteria.\n\nIn TypeScript, a type annotation is used to declare that a given variable is of a particular type, and duck typing allows for the following behavior: if a variable is assigned a value that satisfies the criteria defined by the given interface, then the type annotation can be considered as satisfied as well.\n\nDuck typing helps developers eliminate the need for tedious type declarations and promotes a more flexible coding style, allowing for the rapid prototyping of programs with fewer code lines."}, {"dataset": "koala", "generator": "relative_alpaca_7b_64", "instruction": "how are carbon fibers used in buildings", "output": "Carbon fibers are commonly used as reinforcement for composite materials in the construction industry. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are often used to build components in buildings such as floor slabs, columns, beams, and roofs due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. Carbon fiber reinforcements can also be used to strengthen and repair existing structures, such as concrete or steel structures. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers can reduce weight when compared with traditional construction materials, which reduces energy costs and makes the structure easier to assemble. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites can also be used to create decorative finished on the exterior of buildings. As the use of CFRP composites become more widespread, their applications in construction are expected to expand further."}, {"dataset": "koala", "generator": "relative_alpaca_7b_64", "instruction": "Please summarise in point form \"Challenges for\nAfrican Agriculture\" by Jean-Claude Dev\u00e8ze", "output": "African agriculture faces a variety of challenges, including: \n - Weak policy frameworks and inadequate infrastructure for the agricultural sector. \n - Negative perceptions of the agricultural sector and low productivity levels. \n - Lack of access to finance, technology and markets on the part of small-scale farmers, who are the majority in the continent. \n - Poor management of natural resources and the environment. \n - Lack of rural financial services. \n - Low levels of education and limited access to training. \n - High cost of inputs and difficult access to them. \n - Increased vulnerability to climate change and the impacts of climate variability. \n - Negative demographic trends, especially in terms of population growth and youth unemployment."}, {"dataset": "koala", "generator": "relative_alpaca_7b_64", "instruction": "When I open Anki browser, It shuts down. how can i fix this?", "output": "You can try to troubleshoot the issue by following the steps below: \n1.

That is, the interval between rewards is shorter and more frequent when the reward is broken up into smaller pieces. With a shorter gap between rewards, it takes less effort to keep watching and stay engaged. Additionally, with multiple shorter rewards, it might make the overall experience more enjoyable as opposed to a longer reward at the end. This effect can also explain why it is more enjoyable to play several small games than one long game.

Additionally, changes in heart rate and adrenaline levels can impact the perception of time.

The Spanish colonization of the Aztec Empire would have been short-lived, and the native cultures of Mexico could have continued their development uninterrupted for centuries without the imposition of foreign dominance. Aztec cultural traditions such as the celebration of the Festival of the Dead and indigenous language customs like Nahuatl could have survived and evolved further over time. Economically, the region would have retained its independence and been spared generations of poverty and exploitation under Spanish rule. Political systems, scientific discoveries, and technological advancements could have been developed by Mexican people with the freedom to determine their own paths. Ultimately, the world today would look very different if the Aztecs had succeeded in their defense of their homeland."}, {"dataset": "vicuna", "generator": "relative_alpaca_7b_64", "instruction": "What if the Black Death had not occurred in the 14th century?", "output": "It is difficult to say exactly what the outcomes of the absence of the Black Death would have been, but some possible changes include a sparsely populated Europe with far less demand for agricultural products, resulting in lower prices for food and greater wealth for those who owned land; a shift in power from the elite class to the merchant class, since merchants became increasingly wealthy as landholding elites lost their positions of power; and fewer religious restrictions due to a drop in population, allowing for greater freethinking and new ideas to develop. Additionally, the absence of the Black Death may have led to more progress in fields such as science, art, and literature, as there would be more resources and fewer restrictions."}, {"dataset": "vicuna", "generator": "relative_alpaca_7b_64", "instruction": "What if Isaac Newton had focused on biology instead of physics?", "output": "If Isaac Newton had focused on biology instead of physics, he might have made important contributions to our understanding of the biological sciences. He might have discovered some of the same scientific principles and laws that he did in physics, such as the law of universal gravitation, but he might have applied them instead to the study of living organisms. He might have discovered principles of evolution and natural selection, and he may have developed an understanding of how living organisms adapt to their environments. He might have shaped our understanding of the interrelatedness of different organisms, their interactions and their environment. He may have even developed groundbreaking research in areas such as animal behavior and development, or perhaps even identified some of the biological principles that form the basis of human health.

It's likely that the musical landscape of the late 1960s and 70s would have been markedly different. There might have been more experimentation with traditional rock bands of the time, but without the Beatles' massive influence, pop and rock music might have taken a different direction. It's also possible that other emerging bands of the time might have achieved greater success, or been pushed in different directions by record labels. As the Beatles' influence was felt around the world, it's likely that other bands and acts emulated their sound and style as well.

The code was the primary tool used by the Germans to keep their military activities secret from the Allies, and thus it provided a major advantage to the Germans. If the Allies did not have access to the German forces' plans, the Germans would have had a much easier time in executing their campaigns, potentially leading to a decisive victory for Germany.

Without the Suez Canal, the time and cost to transport goods by sea would be much higher, which could have an effect on global economies and prices of goods. Additionally, it could potentially have an impact on global politics as it may have altered the balance of power in some regions. For example, prior to the Suez Canal, the journey around the southern tip of Africa was much longer and more dangerous, thus making it a much less attractive route for trade. With the construction of the Suez Canal, this route became much more popular and accessible, which had major implications for the economy of the continent and its relationships with other global powers."}, {"dataset": "vicuna", "generator": "relative_alpaca_7b_64", "instruction": "What if the Maya civilization had never mysteriously collapsed?", "output": "The Maya civilization might have continue to thrive and develop in ways that we can only speculate about.

They may have developed new systems of writing and mathematics, and their knowledge of astronomy and science could have been even further advanced.
