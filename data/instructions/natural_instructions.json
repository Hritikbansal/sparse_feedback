Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist John Cassidy of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist Catherine Hickson, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, \"the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all.\"Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. \"We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting\", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava 100 m (330 ft) into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle.\nAs a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic.  During 1920\u201321 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent.\nThrough his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences, and made a partial peace with the writer. By the summer of 1917, as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated, Heseltine's military exemption came under review; to forestall a possible conscription, in August 1917 he moved to Ireland, taking Puma, with whom he had decided he was, after all, in love.In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively. Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons. These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W.B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir. The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture, \"What Music Is\", at Dublin's Abbey Theatre, which included musical excerpts from Bart\u00f3k, the French composer Paul Ladmirault, and Van Dieren. Heseltine's championing of Van Dieren's music led in August 1918 to a vituperative war of words with the music publisher Winthrop Rogers, over the latter's rejection of several Van Dieren compositions. This dispute stimulated Heseltine's own creative powers, and in his final two weeks in Ireland he wrote ten songs, which later critics have considered  to be  among his finest work."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \"Maltworms\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand M\u0101ori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \"Five Bells\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo. He attempted to restore the reputation of a neglected Elizabethan composer, Thomas Whythorne, with a long pamphlet which, years later, brought significant amendments to Whythorne's entry in The History of Music in England. He also wrote a general study of Elizabethan music, The English Ayre.In January 1927, Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society, by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra. A year later, HMV recorded the ballad \"Captain Stratton's Fancy\", sung by Peter Dawson. These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime. His association with the poet and journalist Bruce Blunt led to the popular Christmas anthem \"Bethlehem Down\", which the pair wrote in 1927 to raise money for their Christmas drinking. By the summer of 1928 his general lifestyle had created severe financial problems, despite his industry. In October he was forced to give up the cottage at Eynsford, and returned to Cefn Bryntalch."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death. Sewell's mother, unnamed, was an intermittent girlfriend, a Roman Catholic  who refused Heseltine's offer to pay for an abortion and subsequently blamed herself for his death. Sewell was unaware of his father's identity until 1986."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game.

While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons.

During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416\u2013359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359\u2013299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana."}, {"instruction": " You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or physical relationships, such as a relationship in economics, scientific law, or nature.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement.

Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's primary shareholder, takes little interest in the company beyond playing an annual prank on its board of directors.Alan Bradley, an ENCOM executive and friend to Sam's father, asks Sam to investigate a strange pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade. Sam discovers a large computer in a hidden basement, which suddenly teleports him to the Grid, a virtual reality created by his father that exists within ENCOM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s computer mainframe.[6] He is quickly captured and sent to \"the Games\", where he is forced to fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and begins bleeding, Rinzler realizes that Sam is a human \"User\" and takes him before Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program who resembles a younger Kevin Flynn. Clu nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an \"apprentice\" of Flynn, who conveys him to his father's hideout outside Clu's territory.Flynn reveals to Sam that he had been working to create a \"perfect\" computer system and had appointed Clu and Tron (a security program created by Bradley) its co-creators. During this construction, the trio discovered a species of naturally occurring \"isomorphic algorithms\" (ISOs) not conceived by Flynn, bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science, religion and medicine. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, seemingly killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. Meanwhile, the \"I/O portal\" permitting travel between the two worlds had closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Now that Clu has gained complete control, he sent the message to Alan in order to lure Sam onto the Grid and reopen the portal for a limited time. As Flynn's \"identity disc\" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Flynn to the portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through the portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world.Against his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory on Quorra's tip-off to find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the I/O portal. At the End of Line Club, its owner Castor reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with Clu for the disc, but Clu simply takes the disc and destroys the club along with Zuse. Flynn and Sam stow away aboard a \"solar sailer\" transport program, where Flynn restores Quorra and reveals her to be the last surviving ISO.The transport is intercepted by Clu's warship; as a diversion, Quorra allows herself to be captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, reprogrammed by Clu. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter on the flight deck. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Upon making eye contact with Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, but Clu uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the I/O portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra, having switched discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape together to the real world. In Flynn's arcade, Sam backs up and deactivates the system. He then finds a waiting Bradley and tells him he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Bradley chairman of the board. He departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

People who don't want to suffer the extended darkness leave for Fairbanks or other parts south. As the town gets ready, The Stranger [Ben Foster], rows ashore from a larger ship, then trudges towards Barrow. Once he arrives, he sets about sabotaging the town. He steals and destroys all the cell phones, destroys the town's only helicopter and kills all of the sled dogs.Barrow's sheriff, Eben Oleson [Josh Hartnett] investigates these crimes. As he does so, he learns that his estranged wife, Stella [Melissa George], who moved out of town awhile ago, missed the last plane out of town and will have to spend the 30 day period in Barrow. Although they try to avoid one another, when Eben confronts The Stranger in the town diner, she helps subdue him and take him to the station house.From the jail cell, The Stranger taunts Eben, Stella, Eben's teenaged brother Jake [Mark Rendall], and their grandmother [Elizabeth McRae], telling them that death is coming for them. Just then, vampires attack the local telecommunications center and power supply, rendering the town dark and cut off from the outside world. Eben goes to the telecommunications center and finds the operator's head on a pike. He and Stella then go through town, trying to find the ones responsible for the gruesome crimes.Meanwhile, the vampires, led by Marlow [Danny Huston] attack the town. Marlow speaks in an ancient, gutteral language; the other vampires shriek. Unless they are shot in the head, bullets are useless against them, and they slaughter most of the town, including Eben's grandmother. Those who survive congregate in the diner. The vampires attack Eben and Stella but Beau Brower [Mark Boone Junior], the local snowplow driver, rescues them. They too go to the diner. Everyone decides to go to the boarded up house of someone who had left town earlier that day. The house has a hidden attic where they will be able to hide. Marlow finds The Stranger in the jail and, taking mercy on him in thanks for his work on the vampires' behalf, kills him quickly. Marlow orders the vampires not to turn anyone into a vampire; they will slaughter the town and then disappear in order to preserve modern humanity's belief that vampires are the stuff of bad dreams and nothing more.Over the next week, Eben, Stella, Jake and seven others stick it out in the attic. They fight about leaving but most stay; only Wilson and his senile father, Isaac, are lost. Eben ventures out to try to help a stray survivor and learns that beheading the vampires will kill them. When a blizzard hits, Eben and the others use the whiteout conditions to make it to the general store. There, a young girl vampire attacks them, wounding one of them. The whiteout conditions end, preventing them from making it back to the abandoned house. Eben decides everyone should go to the station house. He will provide a diversion by running to his grandmother's house. She grew marijuana and has an ultraviolet lighting system. Eben makes it to the house, turns on the generator and turns the light on the vampires who have followed him. It hideously burns one, forcing Marlow to kill her. Eben escapes the house but the vampires are in pursuit. Beau comes to the rescue again, killing many of the vampires with his plow. He crashes into a hotel and then ignites a box of dynamite, hoping to incinerate the vampires. His ploy is unsuccessful but it gives Eben the time to make it to the station house. There, the wounded member turns into a vampire. With some shred of his humanity left, he asks Eben to behead him. Eben complies.Two more weeks pass. Stella and Eben see someone signaling them from across the street. It is Billy Kitka [Manu Bennett], Eben's deputy. Eben and Stella make it to Billy's house. When the vampires attacked, he killed his wife and daughters but the gun jammed before he could commit suicide. Stella and Eben take him back to the station house. There they learn that the others have made it to the utilidor, a power station that controls the oil pipeline, the only structure that still has power. Eben, Stella and Billy begin to sneak towards the utilidor. Stella stops to rescue a young girl who is being stalked by a vampire. Eben and Billy try to distract the vampire while Stella gets the girl to safety. Instead, Billy and Eben are separated. They both eventually make it to the utilidor, but a vampire follows Billy.Eben is happy to see the rest of the survivors have made it alive. The vampire attacks Billy, ripping into his neck and cutting off his hand. When the vampire attacks Eben, Billy knocks it into the gears of the utilidor's pump, disintegrating it. Eben then kills Billy before he can turn into a vampire.The sun is due to rise in a few hours. The vampires decide to incinerate the town to cover their tracks. Stella radios to Eben that she and the young girl are hiding under an abandoned truck, the flames rapidly approaching them. Realizing he cannot beat the vampires as a human, Eben injects himself with Billy's infected blood so he can fight them as a vampire. He and Marlow fight a vicious battle and Eben wins. Leaderless, the other vampires disappear.Stella takes Eben to watch the dawn. She holds him in her arms as he is incinerated.

He offers her a monthly payment to stop working as a prostitute and move in with him. After receiving threats from two Turkish Muslims for the work she does, she decides to accept his offer. Ali's son, Nejat Aksu (Baki Davrak), a professor of German literature, does not have time to respond to the prospect of living with a woman of \"easy virtue\" before Ali is stricken with a heart attack. He softens to her: he learns that she has told her 27-year-old daughter she is a shoe saleswoman, sending shoes to her in Turkey to support that story, and wishes her daughter could receive an education like his.Back home from the hospital, Ali suspects Yeter and his son may have had a liaison. When his drunken demands of Yeter cause her to threaten to leave, he strikes her and she dies from the blow. Ali is sent to prison.Nejat travels to Istanbul to search for Yeter's daughter, Ayten (Nurg\u00c3\u00bcl Ye\u00c5\u009fil\u00c3\u00a7ay), and assumes responsibility for her education. Unable to locate her through her family and not having any recent photos of her, he posts flyers with Yeter's photo throughout the area, in hope that it will lead to the daughter. When he posts a flyer in a small German language bookstore that happens to be for sale, he finds himself charmed into buying it.Lotte's DeathA plainclothes officer loses his gun on the street during a riot. A hooded figure scoops it up and is pursued on foot by a battalion of uniformed officers, barely managing to hide the contraband on a random rooftop. This is Ayten, member of a Turkish anti-government resistance group.When her cell is raided, she flees Turkey and takes up a new identity with political allies in Bremen, Germany. However, even there, she has a falling out when she is unable to pay them money she owes, and thus finds herself on the street with barely a euro to her name. Her mother's number is lost, so she lives illegally and searches for her in local shoe shops.Lotte, a university student, offers to help her with food, clothes, and a place to stay\u00e2\u0080\u0094a gesture which is not particularly welcomed by her mother, Susanne. Ayten and Lotte become lovers and Lotte decides to help Ayten search for her mother. The quest is cut short when a traffic stop exposes Ayten's illegal status and she attempts a claim of political asylum. Despite Susanne's financial support, Germany rules that Ayten has no legitimate fear of political persecution. She is deported and immediately imprisoned.Lotte is devastated. She travels to Turkey to try to free Ayten, but quickly realizes how little hope there is, as she is facing 15 to 20 years in jail. Susanne pleads with her to think of her future and return home. When Lotte refuses, her mother denies her any further assistance. Lotte gravitates to Nejat's bookstore and ends up renting a spare room from him.Finally granted a prison visit with Ayten, Lotte complies with her imprisoned lover's request and retrieves the handgun Ayten grabbed in the riot. But Lotte's bag, with the gun inside, is snatched by a crew of boys that she then chases through their neighborhood. When finally she finds them in a vacant lot, one of them is inspecting the gun. She demands he return it, but he points it at her and fires, killing her instantly.The Edge of Heaven (literally, On the Other Side)Upon his release, Ali is deported to Turkey, returning to his property in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast.After her daughter's death, Susanne goes to Istanbul to see where her daughter had been living the past few months.

As a result, she wins her freedom.Susanne asks Nejat about the story behind a Bayram festival they hear about, learning that it commemorates Ibrahim's sacrifice of his son Ishmael. She comments that there is the same story in the Bible, where Abraham is asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Nejat reminisces about being scared by the story as a child and asking his father if he would sacrifice him if God told him to. When asked by Susanne what his father's answer was, Nejat tells her that his father said \"He would make God his enemy in order to protect me.\"Nejat removes the flyer of Yeter from the shop's noticeboard. He asks Susanne to look after his shop while he is gone, and drives to Trabzon, where his father is living.Susanne offers Ayten a place to stay with her at Nejat's house. When Nejat arrives in Trabzon, his father is out fishing, so he waits for him on the beach."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

After killing countless people in their campaign to conquer the planet, the sorcerers were defeated by the Cimmerians led by Corin (Ron Perlman), who destroys the mask, scattering the pieces across the land, and keeping one for himself.Years later, the Cimmerians are at war with a rival clan. Corin's pregnant wife is fatally injured in the battle, but is able to give birth to a son, Conan, before succumbing to her injuries. Conan's birth on a battlefield, and subsequent survival, is considered to be a powerful omen.As an adolescent, Conan (Leo Howard) becomes a fierce, but unfocused, warrior. After a young Conan returns from a warrior's trial with the severed heads of members of a savage tribe, Corin takes the boy to his foundry and teaches him the Riddle of Steel. Conan insists that he is ready to wield his own sword, but Corin reminds him that once a blade has been forged, it must still be tempered with ice before it can be wielded. Not long after, village are attacked by armored warriors, sporting a symbol of a large, two headed serpent. The leader, Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), confronts Corin, demanding his piece of the Mask. When Corin refuses, he is restrained and tortured. Conan, in an angry moment of defiance, attacks one of the warriors, Lucius (Steven O'Donnell), maiming him when he cuts off the man's nose. After recovering the piece of the mask, Zym has Conan and Corin chained to a pole, a cauldron of molten metal hanging precariously above them, then sets fire to the foundry. Corin sacrifices himself to enable Conan to escape. Conan is left an orphan and bears wounds on his palms from his attempts to save his father. Conan wanders out and claims a large sword as his own -- his father's sword was stolen by Zym's daughter, Marique.Twenty years later, Conan (Jason Momoa) is a mercenary, working with a Zamoran pirate named Artus (Nonso Anozie). The two men raid a slave camp and take the survivors to the city of Messantia. The snake cult has grown in size over the last decade, and they have a small garrison in the city. Conan sees Lucius, now an out-of-shape warden, pursuing a pickpocket, Ela-Shan (Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui), and allows himself to be arrested in a bid to learn more about his enemy. Conan soon escapes prison and tortures Lucius for information about Zym and the snake cult. After Conan promises to spare him, Lucius reveals that Zym is seeking the pure blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron, as it will take their blood to unlock the Mask's true power. Satisfied that he has gotten all he can out of Lucius, Conan leaves him at the mercy of the liberated prisoners, reminding the frightened guard \"I only promised I wouldn't kill you.\" Ela-Shan tells Conan that, if he ever needs him to return the favor, Conan will find him at Arlagon, the City of Thieves.Meanwhile, Zym and Marique (Rose McGowan), attack a monastery where they believe the Pureblood is. Sensing something is wrong, the elder priest Fassir (Raad Rawi) instructs one of his students, Tamara Amalia Jorvi-Karashan (Rachel Nichols), to flee to her birthplace, then confronts Zym to buy time for her to escape. Zym recounts how his wife, Maliva, was murdered by Fassir's order. Fassir defends this decision, insisting that Maliva was an insane fanatic who was attempting to unleash occult forces to destroy Hyborea. Enraged by Fassir's defiance, Zym kills him by smashing his head against the marble steps. Marique tests the blood of the remaining students and realizes that the Pureblood is not among them.Tamara's carriage comes under attack by snake cult warriors. Conan comes to her rescue, after a spirited chase, eventually captures their captain, Remo (Milton Welsh). After forcing Remo to reveal Tamara's importance, Conan kills him by catapulting him into Zym's camp with a message in his mouth for Zym to meet him at the Shaipur Outpost alone. Marique verifies that the cloth the message is written on belongs to Tamara.Confident that Zym will not recognize him, Conan masquerades as a bounty hunter, offering to sell Tamara to Zym for a substantial sum of gold. Once he is satisfied that Zym and Marique have come alone, Conan reveals his true intentions, and challenges Zym to a sword fight. At her father's instructions, Marique engages Conan with soldiers made of sand before Zym battles Conan. Conan and Zym first seem to be nearly evenly matched, but Conan's rage gives him the upper hand. Marique ultimately swings the fight in her father's favor by poisoning Conan with a poison-laced boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Artus' boat, stationed nearby, where Artus helps Conan recover.The boat is attacked by the snake cult, who kill several of the crew, though are ultimately repulsed. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they make love. The next day, as she's returning to the boat to join Artus so they can sail away, she's captured by the snake cult.Remembering Ela-Shan's earlier promise, Conan travels to Argalon and hires Shan to help him sneak into Zym's fortress. They discover that beneath the fortress is an old mine, and this is where Zym and Marique plan to sacrifice Tamara, Conan enters through an undersea cave, where the snake cult are preparing to feed prisoners to a giant multi-tendriled serpent, the Dweller. After killing the beast, Conan proceeds further down the mine. Conan attacks the snake cult before they can complete the sacrifice, but Zym has collected enough of Tamara's blood to restore the Mask to suboptimal strength. Zym dons the mask, claiming to be invincible, and proceeds to fight Conan again. Zym uses Corin's sword to fight Conan, but Conan is eventually able to wrest it from his opponent. The battle inadvertently triggers an earthquake, killing most of Zym's followers and rendering the mine unstable. Conan frees Tamara and tells her to run. However, she is followed by Marique. Conan hears Tamara's screams, and kills Marique by throwing her down a mine shaft where she's impaled on a post. As the mine continues to crumble, Conan and Tamara attempt to find an alternate way way out, with an enraged Zym in hot pursuit. Conan and Tamara eventually make their way to an unstable rope bridge, precariously above a massive canyon. As they cross the bridge, a support beam under Tamara gives way, causing her to nearly fall. As Conan attempts to save her before the bridge gives way, they are cornered by Zym, who uses the Mask's power to summon Maliva's spirit. In an act of defiance, Conan proceeds to destroy the bridge supports with his sword, before jumping to safety with Tamara. The bridge collapses, and Zym falls to his death.With the snake cult destroyed, Conan returns Tamara to her birthplace, telling her that they'll meet again. He then returns to his old village and tells his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Zym stole from him, before departing in search of new adventures."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

Nadine is a part-time prostitute, and Manu is a slacker who does anythingincluding occasional porn film actingto get by in her small town in southern France.One day Manu and her friend, a drug addict, are brutally gang-raped by three men. While her friend struggles, screams, and fights against the rapists, Manu lies still with a detached look, which angers the man raping her. Manu then returns to her brother's house, and does not tell him what has happened, but he realises after noticing bruises on her neck. He gets out a gun and asks Manu who was responsible, but when Manu refuses to tell him, he calls her a \"slut\" and implies that she actually enjoyed being raped. In response, Manu picks up his discarded pistol and shoots him in the head.Meanwhile, Nadine returns home and has an argument with her roommate, whom she kills, before leaving with their rent money. Nadine suffers another emotional setback when she meets her best friend, a drug dealer, in another town, but he is shot and killed while out obtaining drugs with a prescription she forged for him.Later that night, having missed the last train, Nadine meets Manu at the railway station. Manu says she has a car, if Nadine will drive for her. They soon realise that they share common feelings of anger, and embark on a violent and sexually charged road trip together. In need of money they hold up a convenience store, and also kill a woman at an ATM. Finally, after much killing and sexual activities, the two women enter a swingers' club and kill everyone there. The pair discuss what they have done, and agree that it has all been pointless because nothing has changed inside them.During their spree the entire country is abuzz over the beautiful bandit/killers. Some people actually support them, while most are in fear. One day Manu enters a roadside tire store to get some coffee, leaving Nadine outside. Hearing gunfire, Nadine rushes in to find Manu shot by the owner, whom she kills. Nadine takes Manu's body to a forest and burns it, before driving to a beach. With tears in her eyes, Nadine puts the gun to her head, intending to commit suicide, but gets arrested by the police before she can do so."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

No one seems to want to have a conversation about it. But what if we dig into it in a completely different way?On March 6th, 1979 my mom Sally Stutz, writer, director, advocate for the disabled, singer, daughter, life of the party, wife, and mother of four went from being a well-rounded and complex human being to being that woman who tragically killed herself. You never hear Einstein described as the physicist who died of an aneurysm. Or George Washington described as the president who died of a throat infection. But take your own life and that becomes the headline for eternity. Even in my mind that final act began, over the years, to define her. She became my mother who killed herself.Like my mother, I became a writer and director and over the next thirty years my work continued to reach back to March 6th - the day that everything changed. But, despite the fact that I was writing plays, comic sketches and all sorts of other oddball material about suicide and mental illness, my family still almost never talked about it. Then my step mom Judith got cancer and decided to talk about something we never discussed when I was a kid. Her dad killed himself too. Three days before her birthday just like my mom had killed herself three days before my birthday. Judith had cradled her fathers head as he died just as I had done for my mother. Yet neither of us said a word. If Judith and I had avoided this conversation all these years then how many other folks out there are still busy changing the subject around the dinner table now?In this movie I set out to change the way we deal with the topic. I sit down with my own family, with suicide survivors and with the family and friends of others who have killed themselves to explore all the surreal thoughts and events that surround the act when youre living through it. I also ask comics, artists, choreographers, musicians, animators and even punk clowns (yes there are punk clowns out there) to put their own unique spin on the subject. Dont want to talk about it? Fine, how about dancing it? How about laughing at it? Or animating it or singing about it or whatever you feel like doing to get your feelings heard? The combination of responses is amazing. The stories are not what youd expect and the performances are balls out to say the least. Teenagers dance to autopsy reports. A jumper gives tips on how to come out of a coma. A nervous stand up comic discovers that suicide is on the minds of his audience in ways that he never imagined. Apparently this suicide thing is not as isolated as you might think.In the Mexican Day of the Dead tradition theres a saying that you die three times; the first when your heart stops beating, the second when they put you in the ground and the third when the last person on earth who can tell a story about you dies. We seek to put that last death off as long as possible and to celebrate the lives of those who have died at their own hand instead of cloaking their existence in shame. Dont Change the Subject invites you to sit back, share a laugh, celebrate life and ponder a very dirty word. Dont be scared. Dont change the subject."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot. You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract.

Thomas Howell) as six hundred and sixty six gigantic interplanetary robots land on Earth.As the robots are landing, two humanoids arrive, one male and one female (Sinead McCafferty). Both are eventually captured by the military who tries to communicate with them. Eventually, the female starts talking to Myron and reveals that she can read his mind along with others. Myron is told that the entire human race is a threat to the rest of the galaxy and unless she is shown the value of humanity by sunset, the planet will be destroyed.Attempts to communicate with the robots fail as they vaporize anyone that tries to attack them or even fires a rifle to get their attention. An effort is made to destroy the robots using Sidewinder Missiles, delivered by YF-22s. The missiles are ineffective and the attacking planes are destroyed by laser attack.The woman, who reveals that her name in its closest English translation is Skye, also displays the ability to harness surrounding energy to protect herself. However, after using that, the military officer in charge of the \"mission\" starts to use a Taser on Skye, forcing Myron to intervene and be thrown off the project. He goes AWOL and as he is driving away, he is contacted by Skye telepathically and he returns to rescue her. The effort proves successful and starts a city-wide search for him and Skye.The male also manages to escape as the robots begin a systemic attack on the planet, first with an EMP (which aids in Josh rescuing Skye). It's also discovered that the robots are slowing down the Earth's core and stopping the planet's rotation.An effort is made to destroy one of the robots with a nuclear explosion, sacrificing 9000 inhabitants of a small island. When the bomb goes off, the machine emerges unharmed and Skye feels the pain of the people dying and almost passes out. Josh takes the time to comfort Skye before the military finds them again. Myron and Skye come across a married couple and have to put the wife in the back of a 4x4, as she is in labour. The husband delivers the child but is unaware of a complication until he realizes that his wife has stopped breathing. Myron hands the infant to Skye and tells her that if she wants to know the value of humanity, \"you're staring at it\". Myron and the husband desperately try to revive the wife but are unsuccessful. Myron realizes that the wife is dead and stops applying CPR. Skye, despite her earlier statement that she would not get involved, changes her mind and uses her powers to resurrect the wife.Skye, now convinced of the value of humanity, needs to get to the closest robot to return home and end the invasion. Before they can get to the robot, Skye is shot by the military. Both are taken back to the base where Skye is treated for the injury as the planet's rotation stops and a major global earthquake hits.The commander realizes, finally, that Myron was telling the truth and helps Myron move Skye to a vehicle. As they leave, they are chased by the psychologist, who is convinced that keeping Skye will prevent the robots from attacking further.At the feet of the robot, Myron is shot by the psychologist; the robot, reacting to a perceived threat, vaporizes him. The robot man arrives, sees both Skye and Myron possibly dead and uses his own powers to revive both. Skye, in gratitude, hugs Myron before both the unnamed man and Skye are beamed aboard. The invasion ends and the robots depart the planet leaving behind major damage (such as half of the Eiffel Tower being destroyed), but the planet intact."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot.

The result is entertaining and unique, with enough laughs, insight, and excitement for adventurous viewers. After seeing the accolades heaped up on a colleague for his laughable film (WE ARE NAKED) at a Los Angeles film festival, Matt (Ross Partridge) decides that he can do better. With his sometime girlfriend, Catherine (Elise Muller), and friends Michelle (Greta Gerwig, HANNAH TAKES THE STAIRS) and Chad (Steve Zissis) in tow, they immediately set off to a cabin in the woods for the weekend to create the film that will make them all famous on the festival circuit. While Chad focuses his energy on winning the affections of uninterested Michelle, Matt comes up with the cinematic construct of a stranger with a paper bag on his head terrorizing a group of people in the woods. After the initial evening of alcoholic brainstorming, though, the idea becomes reality, and the friends' relationships are tested as they find themselves in a truly scary situation.The idea for BAGHEAD was hatched on the set of the THE PUFFY CHAIR when, during a discussion requesting those involved to think of the scariest thing imaginable, someone said, \"A guy with a bag on his head staring into your window.\" Though it may be a flimsy starting point for a film, the Duplasses surround the idea with a believable cast, truthful insight into relationships, and a few genuine chills.

At the same time he struggles in the House of Commons as a backbencher to get a hearing for his concerns about German re-armament under Hitler and the policy of appeasement.Churchill is also disappointed by the behaviour of his son Randolph Churchill (Tom Hiddleston), which leads to further arguments with Clemmie, who announces she is leaving to go on an extended overseas trip. Churchill is devastated and throws himself into his pet activities: painting, and building walls around the family house. Clemmie eventually returns, and the couple are reconciled.During the same period, a young official in the government, Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) has become concerned about the growth of the German Luftwaffe (air force), and is convinced by his wife to leak information about it to Churchill.Shortly afterwards, Churchill uses Wigram's information to launch an attack on the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). In 1936, Wigram commits suicide.With Churchill's fortunes restored, the narrative jumps forward to September 1939, with the declaration of war against Germany at the start of World War II, and the announcement that Churchill will be taking over command of the Royal Navy again as First Lord of the Admiralty.

She drives to Zoe's shack to find her band rehearsing for a concert, and after Amber apologizes for not contacting her, Zoe allows her to sleep there for the night.The next day they find Roger fixing ski-lifts gondolas; he angrily sends them away when they inform him someone knows what happened. Zoe goes to find Colby working as a lifeguard at a public pool; he dismisses her then returns to his post to find \"I know what you did last summer\" written in the ground. Amber is attacked on a ski-lift by someone wielding the hook, but Colby doesn't believe her.Later that night, a drunken Roger contemplates suicide while pulling out the hook from the prank, which he had salvaged from the fire.

The Fisherman swings his hook at Colby but misses; Colby grabs a large butcher knife and stabs the Fisherman in the back, but he appears to be completely unharmed. The Fisherman eventually breaks through a window and hooks Colby in the mouth. Amber and Lance go back to congratulate Zoe but are attacked. Zoe breaks away and is stabbed in the stomach and then thrown over a balcony.

She stops in the middle of nowhere and waits while she talks to Lance. She stands in the middle of the road, and looses reception.

Encysive had been trying to win marketing approval for Thelin since 2005  but the Food and Drug Administration said it was not effective enough.

The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than drop ship  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The prices set forth in                            Section   2.4(a)  shall  be  subject  to   adjustment                            annually  on the  first  day  of  each  Product  Year                            beginning in the calendar  year 2000 and on the first                            day of each succeeding Product Year for the remainder                            of the Term and all  renewals  of this  Agreement  in                            proportion   to  the  increase  or  decrease  in  the                            Consumer  Price Index (CPI) as compared to the CPI as                            it  existed  on the  first  day of the  Term  of this                            Agreement.  The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

If Google is able to do this within a reasonable time, Google will  have no other obligations or liability in relation to that breach.\n\n8.4 Google will not be liable for breach of any of the warranties or other terms in this Agreement to the extent that the breach arises from:\n\n  (a) use of the Products other than in accordance with normal operating procedures;\n\n  (b) any alterations or maintenance to the Products done by anyone other than Google or someone authorised by Google;\n\n  (c) any problem with a computer on which the Products are installed, or with any equipment connected to that computer or any  other software which is installed on that computer;\n\n  (d) any abnormal or incorrect operating conditions; or\n\n  (e) use of the Products in combination with any other hardware or software, unless this use has been approved by Google in  writing.\n\n8.5 Distributor will comply with all applicable commercial and public anti-bribery laws, including, without limitation, the UK's Bribery Act  2010 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (Anti-Bribery Laws), which prohibit (amongst other things) corrupt offers of  anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official to obtain or keep business. ''Government officials include any  government employee, candidate for public office, and employee of government-owned or government-controlled companies, public  international organisations, and political parties. Furthermore, Distributor will not make any facilitation payments, which are payments to  induce officials to perform routine functions they are otherwise obligated to perform.\n\n8.6 No conditions, warranties or other terms apply to the Products, [ * ] or to any other goods or services supplied under this Agreement  unless expressly set out in this Agreement. Subject to Clause 9.1, no implied conditions, warranties or other terms apply (including any  implied terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or conformance with description).\n\n9.

If the amount referred to in (b) above cannot be calculated accurately at the time the relevant liability is to be  assessed (the Applicable Time), it shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis as X/Y x Z. Where:     X = the total sum paid and payable to the Distributor pursuant to Clause 4 in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time;     Y = the number of days elapsed in the relevant Contract Year prior to the Applicable Time; and     Z = 365     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (c) breach of any implied condition as to title or quiet enjoyment; and\n\n  (d) misuse of confidential information.\n\n9.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit either party's liability under Clause 10 (Indemnities), or Distributor's liability under Clause  2 (License Grants and Restrictions), Clause 3.5 (Exclusivity), Clause 3.6 (End User License Agreement) and Clause 3.7 (Accurate  Reproduction) or Clause [ * ].\n\n9.3 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, neither party shall be liable under this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) for any:\n\n  (a) loss of anticipated savings;\n\n  (b) loss of business opportunity (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include loss of advertising revenue);\n\n  (c) loss of or corruption of data;\n\n  (d) loss or damage resulting from third party claims; or\n\n  (e) indirect or consequential losses;\n     suffered or incurred by the other party (whether or not such losses were within the contemplation of the parties at the date of this  Agreement).\n\n9.4 Subject to Clauses 9.1 and 9.2, each party's total liability under or in connection with this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or  otherwise) arising in any Contract Year is limited to the greater of:\n\n  (a) [ * ] Euros ([ * ] Euros); and\n\n  (b) [ * ]% of the total payment due to the Distributor in the relevant Contract Year pursuant to Clause 4 (Payment Terms).\n\n  - 11 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   By Distributor.\n\n   User claim arising out of or resulting from such End Users use of any Distributor App(s), including any actions or claims in product  liability, tort, contract or equity.     *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.

[ * ] will use reasonable  endeavours to [ * ] with [ * ] (to the extent it is practicable to do so) of the [ * ] or [ * ].\n\n10.4 Distributor [ * ] and will indemnify Google against all liabilities, costs, damages and expenses (including settlement costs approved in  writing by Distributor and reasonable legal fees [ * ]) suffered or incurred by Google or any Google Group Company arising from: (a)  Distributor's improper (ie not in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement including the Exhibits) or unauthorised, replication,  packaging, marketing, distribution, or installation of the Products, including any breach of Clause 8.5 and any claims based on  representations, warranties, or misrepresentations made by Distributor, (b) any claim from a third party that the Distributor App(s)  infringe any third party copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or (c) any End\n\n  - 12 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   *Confidential treatment requested  Google Confidential\n\n\n\n10.5 The indemnification obligations set out in Clause 10.4(b) shall exist only if Google: (a) promptly notifies Distributor of such claim, (b)  provides Distributor with reasonable information, assistance and cooperation in responding to and, where applicable, defending the  lawsuit or proceeding, and (c) gives Distributor full control and sole authority over the defense and settlement of such claim. Google may  join in defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense.\n\n10.6 The foregoing Clauses 10.1 to 10.5 states the parties' entire liability and exclusive remedy with respect to infringement of a third party's  Intellectual Property Rights.\n\n11.

Without limiting the preceding sentence, each of the following shall appear on the End User's desktop exactly as shown in  this Exhibit B: (i) the location and size of the Chrome Browser window and the Distributor App window, (ii) the z-order of the Distributor App and  the Chrome Browser, and (iii) the number and content of the tabs in the Chrome Browser (i.e., the Chrome Browser shall contain exactly two (2)  tabs, with the first tab set to google.com, and the second tab set to http://tools.google.com/chrome/intlfen-US/welcome.html (or such other url as  Google may specify). In no event shall the Chrome Browser window be minimized.

Note that this authorisation may be revoked at any time and  Distributor shall then include the 6 months flag again in future builds.\n\n\n\n  - 22 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  EXHIBIT C     Guidelines for Applications Bundled with Google Applications     Google has observed a significant increase in the number of reports of software that is engaging in deceptive, malicious and other annoying  practices that significantly diminish user perception and enjoyment of the internet. These practices include but are not limited to installing  software on computers without obtaining informed end user consent (the so-called drive-by download), inundating end users with  advertisements without adequate attribution or labeling, exposing users to pornographic material without obtaining informed end user consent,  obtaining or transmitting personal information about an end user without obtaining informed end user consent, and interfering with an end user's  ability to easily uninstall applications the end user does not wish to be on his or her computer.     Google does not wish to be associated with these types of practices. Accordingly, Google has developed the Guidelines set forth below to prevent  its trademark, other intellectual property, and services from being used in connection with these practices. Google believes that these Guidelines  are necessary to protect Google from any allegation that it has contributed to practices that might be viewed as unlawful or actionable; to preserve  the reputation of Google as a provider of trusted software and services in a manner that is beneficial and fair to users and other constituents; and  to stem the rising incidence of practices that harm users and diminish the perceived value and reliability of the internet, which are essential to  Google's business.     With this objective in mind, Google has established the following Guidelines to apply to customer Applications that are bundled with any Google  Application. Except to the extent Google has otherwise specifically agreed in writing, Google does not grant permission to, and you will not,  bundle any Application with a Google Application unless you ensure that any such Application specified in the agreement between you and  Google that incorporated these Guidelines complies with these Guidelines.     For the avoidance of doubt, by these Guidelines Google does not intend to, and does not, impose any restrictions on what you may do with any  Application that is not bundled with a Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google  services; you remain free to sell any Application you wish (whether or not it complies with these Guidelines) so long as it is not bundled with a  Google Application, bundled with an Application that accesses Google services, or used to access Google services.     In these Guidelines: (a) you and your refer to the legal entity(ies) that has entered into the contract with Google into which these Guidelines  are incorporated, as well as any person or entity acting on your behalf; and (b) Application means any application, plug-in, helper, component or  other executable code that runs on a user's computer, examples of which include those that provide browser helper objects, instant messaging,  chat, email, data, file viewing, media playing, file sharing, games, internet navigation, search and other services.    Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 23 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google welcomes input about these Guidelines from you and from other interested parties, and is always willing to consider revisions as  appropriate to encourage innovation while protecting against deceptive, unfair and harmful practices. Accordingly, Google may update these  Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time as provided in Section 10 below.     If you have any questions about these Guidelines, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your Google account manager.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  - 24 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   1. General.     1.1 Approval and Ongoing Compliance. You may bundle Google Applications with Applications only to the extent permitted in the  signed written agreement into which these Guidelines have been incorporated. In such instance, you must ensure that your Application both (1)  has been approved by Google for the purpose of being bundled with Google Applications in writing in advance, and (2) complies at all times with  the requirements outlined herein. To obtain Google's approval for any Applications not expressly approved in your agreement, you must submit a  written request.     1.2 No Google Branding or Attribution. Your Application, and any related collateral material (including any Web pages promoting your  Application or from which your Application is made available), must not contain any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then  only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing. In addition, queries entered into Applications may not resolve to a results page  that contains any Google branding, trademarks or attribution unless (and then only to the extent) Google expressly consents otherwise in writing.     2. Prohibited Content. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that: (a) contains any viruses, worms, trojan horses, or the  like; and (b) is distributed primarily for the purpose of (i) distributing pornographic, obscene, excessively profane, gambling-related, deceptive,  fraudulent or illegal content, or (ii) distributing content related to hacking or cracking.     3. Prohibited Behavior. You may not bundle any Google Application with an Application that engages in deceptive, unfair, harassing or otherwise  annoying practices. For example, the Application may not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) use, or permit an unaffiliated person to use, an end user's computer system for any purpose not understood and  affirmatively consented to by the end user (including, without limitation, for purposes of consuming bandwidth or  computer resources, sending email messages, launching denial of service attacks, accruing toll charges through a dialer  or obtaining personal information from an end user's computer such as login, password, account or other information  personal to the end user);\n\n  (b) intentionally create or exploit any security vulnerabilities in end user computers;\n\n  (c) trigger pop-ups, pop-unders, exit windows, or similar obstructive or intrusive functionality, that materially interfere with  an end user's Web navigation or browsing or the use of his or her computer;\n\n  (d) repeatedly ask an end user to take, or try to deceive an end user into taking, an action that the end user has previously  declined to take (such as repeatedly asking an end user to change his or her home page or some other setting or  configuration);\n\n  - 25 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4. Disclosure and Consent.     4.1 Disclosure and Consent before Installation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless you (and your  distribution and bundling partners, if applicable under the terms of the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these Guidelines)  design the installation of any such Application in a manner that ensures that it is installed by end users in a knowing and willful manner - e.g., no  drive-by' downloads or installs. By distribution partner we mean any third party who distributes your Application and by bundling partner  we mean any third party who installs your Application in combination with or alongside one or more other Applications. At a minimum, compliance  with this provision requires that, prior to installing your Application, you and any third party distributing or bundling your Application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.2 Disclosure and Consent for Collection and Transmission of Personally Identifiable information. You may not bundle any Google  Application with any Application that (1) collects or transmits to any entity other than the end user personally identifiable information, or (2)  collects or transmits information related to a user's computer or Internet usage or activity in a manner that could collect or transmit such user's  personally identifiable information (such as through keystroke logging), unless prior to the first occurrence of any such collection or transmission  you:\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (e) redirect browser traffic away from valid DNS entries (except that your Application may direct unresolved URLs to an  alternative URL designated by you, provided that the page to which the end user resolves adequately informs the end  user that you and your Application are the source of that page);\n\n  (f) interfere with the browser default search functionality (except that your Application may permit an end user to change  his or her default search engine with proper disclosure, consent and attribution as provided below); or\n\n  (g) engage in activity that violates any applicable Jaw or regulation.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose to end users:\n\n  (i) that they are installing an application,\n\n  (ii) the name of the Application, identifying you as the entity responsible for it, and\n\n  (iii) the principal and significant features and functionality of the Application; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to install the Application.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose:\n\n  - 26 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   4.3 Disclosure and Consent for Setting Changes. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that makes a  change to any operating system or Application data setting which will impact the user experience of other Applications (e.g., changing the  browser default home page or changing the default application for a file type, such as the default email, browser or media player application),  unless prior to making such change you:\n\n\n\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no disclosure and consent need be made for changes to operating system or Application data settings that  have only a minor impact on user experience, such as adding a small number of bookmarks to the browser menu or adding an item to a start menu,  and (ii) the disclosure and consent requirements of this Section 4.3 will not apply to those setting changes that may be made prior to sale to the  end user.     4.4 Method of Disclosure and Consent. In order to satisfy the requirements above, the disclosure of the items specified above (a) must be  provided in both (1) the End User License Agreement (EULA) or privacy policy (to the extent required by law or otherwise by industry custom)  and (2) separately from the EULA and/or privacy policy (e.g. in installation screens or message boxes, as the case may be), and (b) must be  designed so that it will be read by, adequately inform and evidence the consent of a typical Internet user. See Attachment 1 for sample disclosure  and consent implementations that would satisfy certain of the requirements above.     4.5 EULA and Privacy Policy. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application unless it conforms, and is distributed  pursuant to a EULA that conforms, with all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, you and your Application must comply with the  agreements and representations you make with your end users in your EULA and privacy policy. Your privacy policy must be accessible from  your Application in an easily found location. If your Application collects or transmits any other information related to the user's use of his or her  computer, but not required to be disclosed and consented to pursuant to Section 4.2, then the collection and use of such other information must  be disclosed in your privacy policy.     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (i) the type of information collected (described with specificity in the case of personally identifiable information),\n\n  (ii) the method of collection (e.g. by registration, etc.), and\n\n  (iii) the location of (i.e., a link to) the privacy policy that governs the collection, use and disclosure of the  information; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to such collection and/or transmission.\n\n  (a) first, fully, accurately, clearly and conspicuously disclose the change in a manner that will explain the practical effect of  such change; and\n\n  (b) then, obtain the end user's affirmative consent to make such change.\n\n  - 27 -\n\n\n\n\n\n   5. Transparency. Neither you nor any of your third party distribution or bundling partners may mislead end users or create end user confusion  with regard to the source or owner of an Application or any portion of its purpose, functionality or features. For example, all elements of your  Application that are visible to the end user must clearly identify their source through its branding and attribution, and that identification, whatever  form it takes, must correspond to the identification of your application in the menu that permits end users to remove programs. You must clearly  label advertisements provided by your Application (if any) as such and clearly identify your Application as the source of those advertisements. In  addition, if your Application modifies the operation or display of other applications or Web sites (other than Web sites that you own), then in  each instance you must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of that modification to your Application (as distinct from the application or  Web site modified) in a manner that will inform a typical Internet user; provided that this requirement will not apply to modifications for which you  obtain disclosure and consent pursuant to Section 4.3. See Attachment 1 for examples of modifications that are clearly and conspicuously  disclosed to end users.     6. Deactivation. You may not bundle any Google Application with any Application that impairs an end user's ability to change any preferences or  settings set by the Application in accordance with the way that such preferences or settings ordinarily may be changed by the applicable  Application. Once disabled by an end user, your Application may not be re-enabled without an affirmative action by the end user to explicitly re- enable your application. Accordingly, no use, update, installation or re-enablement of a separate Application, and no code downloaded as a result  of browsing a Web site, may operate to re-enable your Application. Your Application must permit end users to uninstall it (in the customary place  the applicable operating system has designated for adding or removing programs, e.g., Add/Remove Programs control panel in Windows) in a  straightforward manner, without undue effort or skill. In addition, your Application, when running, must provide (in an easily found location) clear  and concise instructions on how it may be uninstalled. Once uninstalled, your Application must not leave behind any functionality or design  elements, and all setting changes made by the application, but not explicitly agreed to by the end user, should be reversed to the extent  practicable.     7. Bundling of Applications. In addition to the requirements set forth in the agreement between you and Google that incorporates these  Guidelines, in order for you to bundle any Application with a Google Application must satisfy each of the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n   Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (a) the end user is made aware of all of the Applications included in the bundle prior to any installation;\n\n  (b) all such Applications included in the bundle or download comply with the provisions of Section 2 through 6 of these  Guidelines;\n\n  (c) if Applications in a bundle in which you are participating are supported in part by revenue generated by advertising  displayed in another independent Application included in that bundle and the continued use of the Application is  conditioned on such other independent Application remaining installed and active on the end user's computer, the end  user must be made aware of that relationship; and\n\n  - 28 -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   8. Information and Assistance. Subject to any confidentiality obligations owed to third parties, you must provide Google with such information as  Google may reasonably request about the distribution of those of your Applications that are bundled with any Google Application. For example,  we may ask you to share with us: (a) the means by and/or the locations from which your Applications are distributed; or (b) the identity of any  applications included in any of your bundling relationships (and the entities responsible for such applications). In addition, you must provide  such assistance as Google may reasonably request to investigate and stop potential violations of these Guidelines that may be connected to your  Application, including by way of using such number of identifiers and other tracking parameters as Google may reasonably request. This would  include providing Google with golden masters of any bundle or other distribution that includes your Application, or working with Google to  stop any entities that may be financially benefiting from your Application from engaging in any of these proscribed practices. You understand,  however, that Google has no obligation to provide support to end users of your Application. For the avoidance of doubt, these information and  assistance rights do not extend to any of your Applications that are not used to access Google services, bundled with a Google Application, or  bundled with an Application that accesses Google services.     9. Legal. You must maintain ownership and control of your Application at all times to the extent required to practically and legally enforce the  requirements of these guidelines. If you are seeking to permit a third party Application to be bundled with a Google Application, then you must  also obtain Google's written approval of that third party Application (in addition to the approval required for your Application). If Google  approves the third party Application, you are responsible for ensuring that such third party Application also complies with these Guidelines.  Special indemnity and other suspension and/or termination provisions may apply. These are addressed in your agreement with Google.     10. Updates.     10.1 General. As mentioned above, Google may update these Guidelines, including the Attachments, from time to time; provided,  however, that no updates will be effective until Google provides you with thirty (30) days' written notice thereof. Once you receive that notice (the  date on which you receive such notice, the Update Notice Date), you will be required to bring your Application into compliance within thirty (30)  days     Google Confidential\n\n\n\n  (d) either (1) the bundle must provide for a master uninstaller that will enable the end user to uninstall every Application in  the bundle without undue effort or skill, or (2) if no master uninstaller is provided, the de-installation of any Application  may not be dependent or conditioned upon the de-installation of any other Application included in the bundle.\n\n  - 29 -\n\n\n\n\n\n  10.2 Extended Compliance Period. If, solely as a result of an updated requirement, one or more of your Applications no longer complies  with these Guidelines, as updated, and you are incapable of bringing such Application into compliance prior to the scheduled effective date of  such update (the Update Effective Date), you agree to provide Google with written notice thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any  event no later than the Update Effective Date, identifying the Application and the reasons why it may not be brought into compliance prior to the  Update Effective Date, and providing such other detail as Google may reasonably request with respect thereto (consistent in any event with your  confidentiality obligations). Thereafter, the parties will consult, and you agree to will work, diligently and in good faith to develop and execute a  plan to bring such Application into compliance with these Guidelines, as updated, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within  ninety (90) days of the Update Notice Date (the Maximum Compliance Period). You agree that you will provide Google with such information as  Google reasonably requests during this period to keep Google apprised of your progress in bringing your Application into compliance.  Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the next sentence), in no event may a new requirement provided for in any update to these  Guidelines require you to take any action which would violate the terms of any agreement between you and any unaffiliated third party that is in  effect on the date that Google delivers notice of the proposed update. In any event, if you are unable to bring any Application into compliance  during the Maximum Compliance Period, Google may elect, by providing at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, to require you to cease  bundling either the specific non-conforming Application or those versions of the Application which are, or are distributed, in violation of the  Guidelines, as updated; it being understood that, at such time, you will be entitled to procure services from an alternative source for those  Applications (or versions thereof) with respect to which Google has exercised such election.

If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents of the applicable Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Remarketing Agents on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total Remarketing Fee received by the Remarketing Agents, as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Final Prospectus.   27\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Remarketing Agents on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Remarketing Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Remarketing Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the applicable Securities remarketed by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Remarketing Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations with respect to such Remarketed Securities and not joint.\n\n(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Remarketing Agent within the meaning of the Act. The obligations of the Remarketing Agents under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Remarketing Agent may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.\n\n7. Resignation and Removal of the Remarketing Agents. A Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder, and the Company may remove any or all of the Remarketing Agents, by giving five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the Stock Purchase Contract Agent and, in the case of a removal, to the Remarketing Agents; provided that no such resignation nor any removal of all the Remarketing Agents shall become effective until the Company shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized broker-dealer as successor to the Remarketing Agents, and such successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a   28\n\n\n\n\n\nletter substantially in the form of Annex III hereof with the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent in which it shall have agreed to conduct the Remarketing in accordance with the Remarketing Procedures. The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the resignation or removal of the Remarketing Agents pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n8. New Remarketing Agents. The Company may appoint any institution or institutions as new Remarketing Agent(s) hereunder (each a New Remarketing Agent) in respect of the Remarketing in which event, upon the confirmation by such institution through a letter to the Company and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent confirming acceptance of such nomination by the New Remarketing Agent substantially in the form of Annex III hereof, such New Remarketing Agent shall become a party hereto, unless otherwise provided for herein, with all the authority, rights, powers, duties and obligations as if originally named as Remarketing Agent hereunder. The Company will notify the Remarketing Agent(s) appointed in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities and the Stock Purchase Contract Agent of a change in the identity of other Remarketing Agents appointed or who have resigned in respect of the Remarketing of the Remarketed Securities generally as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\n9. Offering Restrictions. Each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree that it has not remarketed or delivered and it will not remarket or deliver, any of the Remarketed Securities, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that are reasonably designed to result in compliance with the applicable securities laws and regulations thereof. In particular, each Remarketing Agent acknowledges, represents and agrees and each additional Remarketing Agent appointed pursuant to Section 8 of this Remarketing Agreement will be required to acknowledge, represent and agree as set forth in Annex V to this Remarketing Agreement.\n\n10. Dealing in the Remarketed Securities. Each Remarketing Agent, when acting hereunder, or when acting in its individual or any other capacity, may, to the extent permitted by law, buy, sell, hold or deal in any of the Remarketed Securities. The Remarketing Agents may exercise any vote or join in any action which any beneficial owner of Remarketed Securities may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Indenture with like effect as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agents, in their individual capacities, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Company as freely as if they did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\n11. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. This Remarketing Agreement shall terminate (i) in the event of a Remarketing that is not a Successful Remarketing or (ii) as to any Remarketing Agent who resigns or is removed, on the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 7. In addition, the   29\n\n\n\n\n\nobligations of the Remarketing Agents may be terminated by them by notice given to the Company prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the Remarketing Settlement Date if, prior to that time, any of the applicable conditions precedent to the obligations of the Remarketing Agents described in Section 5 hereof shall have failed to occur.\n\n12. Survival. Notwithstanding any such termination set forth in Section 11 hereof, the obligations set forth in Section 4 hereof shall survive and remain in full force and effect until all amounts payable under said Section 4 shall have been paid in full. In addition, the former Remarketing Agents shall be entitled to the rights and benefits under Section 6 of this Remarketing Agreement notwithstanding the replacement or resignation of the Remarketing Agents. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Remarketing Agents, as set forth in this Remarketing Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Remarketing Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Remarketing Agent or any controlling person of any Remarketing Agent, the Company or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.\n\n13.

We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\n In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

In this paper, we propose a novel method SRatio that can utilize information from high performing complex models (viz. deep neural networks, boosted trees, random forests) to reweight a training dataset for a potentially low performing simple model such as a decision tree or a shallow network enhancing its performance. Our method also leverages the per sample hardness estimate of the simple model which is not the case with the prior works which primarily consider the complex model's confidences/predictions and is thus conceptually novel. Moreover, we generalize and formalize the concept of attaching probes to intermediate layers of a neural network, which was one of the main ideas in previous work \\citep{profweight}, to other commonly used classifiers and incorporate this into our method. The benefit of these contributions is witnessed in the experiments where on 6 UCI datasets and CIFAR-10 we outperform competitors in a majority (16 out of 27) of the cases and tie for best performance in the remaining cases. In fact, in a couple of cases, we even approach the complex model's performance. We also conduct further experiments to validate assertions and intuitively understand why our method works. Theoretically, we motivate our approach by showing that the weighted loss minimized by simple models using our weighting upper bounds the loss of the complex model."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

However, when a layer is removed, the model learns to produce a different image that still looks natural to an adversary, which is possible by removing objects.

In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think. In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow. This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to too few warmup steps) may track that of VI (due to too few optimization steps), up to differences due to VI\u2019s parameterization and asymptotic bias. Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and momentum-accelerated versions) do evolve similarly. This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it\u2019s far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains)."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper.

In this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic poisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial training examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a Generative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and the target classifier. This approach allows us to model naturally the detectability constrains that can be expected in realistic attacks and to identify the regions of the underlying data distribution that can be more vulnerable to data poisoning.

If someone jerked the bag, it is so big and strong, the person might jerk me down to ground!, Review_2: it is light weight and has many compartments. I wish it was just a little larger. There is a 400 item which is too big-rhis is a 200 item which is fulls up fast; therefore; I would like to see the company make a 300 series., Review_3: I love this bag although I would have preferred it to be a litle smaller. It is light enough that I can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my Kindle. I love this particular shade of blue. It goes well with most everything I wear. I also appreciate the pockets for separating things., Review_4: Took this bag on a recent trip to Europe and it was great. No worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. The two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella., Review_5: I checked this on two different monitors before I ordered. Both looked more rose color. It's very much a dark purple. Which I'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up, Review_6: Wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an AMAZING bag. I couldn't believe how much stuff I got in there on a recent trip. Comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. Love this bag., Review_7: I used this for the first time last week on a trip to Maine. We normally drive so I was worried about carrying things on the plane. This handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups. I love it!, Review_8: This is the purse for all to have when you have children or you need to have it while traveling on trips!

I love it so much that I bought it in three colors., Review_2: This is a really cute shoe that feels very comfortable on my high arches. The strap on the instep fits my feet very well, but I have very slim feet. I can see how it would be uncomfortably tight on anyone with more padding on their feet., Review_3: I love these sandals. The fit is perfect for my foot, with perfect arch support. I don't think the leather is cheap, and the sandals are very comfortable to walk in. They are very pretty, and pair very well with pants and dresses., Review_4: My wife is a nurse and wears dansko shoes. We were excited to try the new crimson sandal and normally order 39 sandal and 40 closed toe. Some other reviews were right about a narrow width and tight toe box. We gave them a try and passed a great pair of shoes to our daughter with her long narrow feet, and she loves them..., Review_5: Finally, a Dansko sandal that's fashion forward! It was love at first sight! This is my 4th Dansko purchase. Their sizing, quality and comfort is very consistent. I love the stying of this sandal and I'm pleased they are offering bolder colors. Another feature I love is the Dri-Lex topsole - it's soft and keeps feet dry., Review_6: I really love these sandals. my only issue is after wearing them for a while my feet started to swell as I have a high instep and they were a little tight across the top. I'm sure they will stretch a bit after a few wears, Review_7: I have several pairs of Dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly. So I felt confident when I ordered the Tasha Sandal in size 39. I don't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small. Otherwise, I love them. They are very cushiony and comfortable!, Review_8: I own many Dansko shoes and these are among my favorites. They have ALL the support that Dansko offers in its shoes plus they are very attractive.

I disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. The smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. I love the design and it was a fair price. Shipping was a little expensive though. It arrived quickly and I would buy from this seller again., Review_4: I really enjoy the design of this case but I thought it would be lighter.

DON'T BUY IT., Review_7: I have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. It's working well though and now I can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag.

The one pictured showed a grounded plug with an OEM Brick.

The adapter made so much noise that I could not charge the computer in the office.

I purchased from Abe, s Of Maine thru Amazon and the customer service was top notch except i have to pay shipping to return it but that, s better than a $154 paperweight., Review_3: I got this tablet as a free gift, but didn't think it was this cheap! I got the tablet and had it for about 1 month. My kids used it to play games which seemed to work fine until one day about a month after having it would no longer power up. What do I do?

Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.

", "input": "Context: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851\u20131921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you're given passages that contain mentions of names of people, places, or things.

The opening of a specialist cinema in a Member State shall not entitle any other Member State to grant any direct or indirect aid, whether financial or other, which would have the effect of distorting the conditions of establishment.In particular, no such aid shall be granted for:  - the construction, reconstruction or modernisation of any cinema;- the execution of work in connection with safety, hygiene or technical improvements;- the purchasing of equipment;- the renting of full-length films;- the covering of risks or trading losses.Any and every kind of aid available in the Member State in question for the opening of a specialist cinema shall be available without discrimination to operators who are nationals of other Member States of the Community.Beneficiaries from Member States shall in no instance be treated less favourably than natural persons or companies or firms from third countries.

The Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission and at the request of a Member State, may, by a qualified majority, authorise that State to impose limits on the exhibition, whether in specialist or in non-specialist cinemas, of foreign films in the language of their country of origin where such language is that of the region in which the cinema is situated.

Concept 8 Review. Cytokinesis in Plant Cells. Plant cells have walls, so cytokinesis cannot proceed with a cleavage furrow. Instead, during telophase a cell plate forms across the cell in the location of the old metaphase plate. During telophase, membrane-enclosed vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus migrate to the center of the cell where the metaphase plate used to be and fuse to form a cell plate. Best Answer: Cytokinesis is the process in which the cytoplasm of a plant cell is split. After replication of the nucleus, the cell plate forms in the center of the cell. This plate continues to grow until it completely divides the cell which is the completion of cytokinesis. During cytokinesis, the organs and all of the cytoplasm are split between the two cells. As the phragmoplast often forms off cell center, the attachment of the cell plate to the cell plate fusion site first occurs at one site and then progresses to other sites until the fusion is complete (Figures 1 1 and S3; [41 x Polarized cytokinesis in vacuolate cells of Arabidopsis.

The daughter cells are about = in size. The activity of each cell continues because they each have their own DNA and organelles Cytokinesis is the final step in the process by which a eukaryotic cell -- that is, a cell with an organized nucleus -- divides into two cells. This division of cytoplasm is preceded by one of two processes of nuclear division -- mitosis or meiosis -- that distributes chromosomes to each side of a cell before it divides. During plant cell cytokinesis, a cell plate is formed, beginning the division of the cell wall and cytoplasm. During animal cell cytokinesis, the cleavage furrow is formed, wh\u2026ich is a pinching in of the cell membrane, which begins the division of the cells cytoplasm and cellular membrane.

USING RETROACTIVE EFFECTIVE DATES IN AGREEMENTS. Tax effects flow from the date transactions occur. For example, in a recent Tax Court case, a dispute arose in regard to a change in ownership of interests in a limited liability company (LLC). In the end, the IRS position was upheld. It is interesting that this is the opposite of what you would expect \u2013 normally it is the taxpayer that wants to use the prior effective date and the IRS seeking to ignore it. The case was instructive of several principles that apply to retroactive effective dates. These include: For LLC's taxable as a partnership, the members are of the LLC are taxable directly on their percentage share of the income and losses of the LLC. Therefore, a transfer of an interest will result in changes to the shares of income (or loss) to be allocated to the involved members, effective as of the date of transfer. -The Tax Court will be more willing to accept a retroactive effective date if it can be shown that the later written documents is merely a memorialization of a prior oral agreement. Therefore, if this is the case, it would probably be helpful to recite this in the documentation.

For example, in a recent Tax Court case, a dispute arose in regard to a change in ownership of interests in a limited liability company (LLC). Therefore, the documentation will often indicate a date the documents are signed, and a retroactive effective date for the transfer. In the case mentioned above, the taxpayers had such a retroactive effective date. However, they did not report their ownership as being changed as of the retroactive effective date in filing their tax returns. Therefore, if one is seeking a retroactive effective date for tax purposes, the first requirement is that the document be above board as to what is going on. Thus, showing the true date the agreement is signed, along with an earlier effective as of clause, is advisable. -To be effective, a retroactive effective date must be allowable under applicable state law. In the case, the Tax Court noted that this was the case in Georgia, the state involved. -The purpose of the retroactive dating cannot be to obtain an unwarranted tax benefit. The effective date of the rule will be 180 days from the date that it is published in the Federal Register, which was January 15, 2016.

Cuts in the order of \u00a31bn for research also appear to be proposed.\"\nA \u00a34.2bn cut in funding would be almost four times that which universities had been expected to make by the previous government.\nProfessor Smith says the Browne report, which itself called for unlimited tuition fees, was framed by \"what is coming on October 20\".\nAnd he adds that universities will do all they can to \"replace as much of this lost funding as possible\". This means raising tuition fees to make up for lost state funding, he says.\nBut he also warns that this may not be possible before 2012, when the government is expecting to have measures in place to allow for a rise in fees.\nHe adds: \"The biggest worry is simple to state: if Browne fails to get through the Commons, or gets unpicked, or gets accepted but only after major changes are made, we will simply not be able to replace the unprecedented reductions in state funding that are coming in the Spending Review.\"\nResponding to the claim, the general secretary of the UCU, Sally Hunt, said: \"It is hard to believe that any government could contemplate making \u00a34.2bn cuts to higher education given that it generates massive economic growth.\n\"Cuts of this magnitude will leave many cities and towns without a local university and our students paying the highest public fees in the world.\"\nShe called for an urgent review of the impact of \"these unimaginable cuts\".\nPresident of the NUS Aaron Porter said: \"The devastating scale of the cuts to publicly funded degrees planned for next week is laid bare by this admission.\n\"The true agenda of the coalition government this week is to strip away all public support for arts, humanities and social science provision in universities and to pass on the costs directly to students' bank accounts.\"\nHe accused vice-chancellors of standing by plans that would lead to many universities closing down.\nA spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills dismissed the figures as speculation\nHe added: \"Lord Browne made recommendations to government this week on a new funding system.  His proposals are for graduates to make a greater contribution to the cost of their education, linked to their ability to pay.\n\"These recommendations are currently under consideration and are informing our comprehensive spending review negotiations with the Treasury.

(Associated Press) \n  \n This image taken from CCTV video obtained by the Turkish broadcaster TRT World and made available on Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2018, shows a vehicle allegedly belonging to the Saudi consulate, at the entrance to Belgrade Forest in Istanbul, Turkey, Monday, Oct. 1, 2018. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan... (Associated Press) \n  \n RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 In a fiery and unwavering appearance Wednesday at an investment forum, Saudi Arabia's crown prince called the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi \"heinous\" and \"painful to all Saudis,\" before warning anyone against trying to \"manipulate\" the crisis and drive a wedge between the kingdom and Turkey. \n  \n Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was joined onstage by two Arab allies as he made his first extensive public remarks about the killing that has sparked widespread condemnation and marred his international standing after Turkish reports said a member of his entourage was involved in the crime. \n  \n Many international business leaders pulled out of the Future Investment Initiative, the kingdom's main economic forum, after the Oct. 2 killing of The Washington Post columnist inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. \n  \n But in the forum's vast and ornate auditorium, thousands of people who did attend rose to their feet to applaud the 33-year-old heir whose strong showing underscored his reputation for being bold and assertive. \n  \n Prince Mohammed, who spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone before the forum, addressed the case immediately after taking the stage for a panel discussion, saying the Saudis were cooperating with Turkey on the Khashoggi investigation. \n  \n \"The situation that took place is very painful to all Saudis, especially because it was a Saudi citizen. And I suspect it is painful to anyone in the whole world,\" Prince Mohammed said. \n  \n \"It is a heinous act that is unjustifiable,\" he added, before cautioning anyone who might try \"to manipulate the situation\" and sow division between Riyadh and Ankara. \n  \n \"I have a message for them: They will not be able to do that as long as there is a king called Salman bin Abdul-Aziz and a crown prince called Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi, and a president in Turkey called Erdogan,\" he said to applause. \n  \n Erdogan on Tuesday delivered a sharp rebuttal of Saudi Arabia's widely criticized account that the dissident writer died accidentally in a brawl, saying Saudi officials had planned the killing for days. \n  \n He kept up the pressure Wednesday, saying in Ankara: \"We are determined not to allow the murder to be covered up and for those responsible \u2014 from the person who gave the order to those who executed it \u2014 not to escape justice.\" \n  \n Erdogan has said that 15 Saudi officials arrived in Istanbul shortly before Khashoggi's death and that a man, apparently dressed in the writer's clothes, acted as a possible decoy by walking out of the consulate on the day of the disappearance. \n  \n Turkish officials say the 15 men comprised a Saudi hit squad that included a member of Prince Mohammed's entourage on overseas trips. Saudi Arabia has suggested, without offering evidence, that the team went rogue. It has arrested 18 Saudis and fired five top officials, some of whom worked directly under the crown prince. \n  \n Turkish media have published a security camera image showing a vehicle belonging to the Saudi Consulate purportedly scouting a forest in the outskirts of Istanbul before the killing. \n  \n The killing of the 59-year-old Khashoggi has created an international firestorm as suspicion mounts that the crown prince had a hand in the killing. \n  \n \"Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him,\" President Donald Trump was quoted telling the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. \n  \n Khashoggi, who lived in self-imposed exile in the U.S. for nearly a year before his death, had written critically of the young prince's crackdown on dissent. Dozens of Saudi activists, writers, clerics and even women who were behind calls for the right to drive have been detained. \n  \n King Salman and Prince Mohammed met Tuesday with Khashoggi's son, Salah, and his brother, Sahel, at the Yamama Palace, where the royals expressed their condolences, according to state-run Saudi news, which distributed photos of the event. A friend of the Khashoggi family told The Associated Press that Salah has been under a travel ban since last year. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal. \n  \n The crisis overshadowed the crown prince's high-profile economic forum, aimed at raising much needed investments to underwrite his plans to overhaul the Saudi economy. \n  \n After the killing, many international business leaders and Western officials pulled out of the forum, including the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Uber, Siemens and Blackrock. Western media outlets withdrew as partners for the event. \n  \n Instead, the forum spotlighted how the kingdom's regional allies have rushed to rally behind the crown prince. \n  \n On stage with him was Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who abruptly resigned his post last year during a strange visit to Saudi Arabia in which many people suspected that he was held against his will. Hariri returned to Lebanon and to his post later that year after French mediation and has visited Saudi Arabia and met with the crown prince since then. \n  \n The crown prince even joked about the incident at the forum, saying Hariri would be in Saudi Arabia this time for two days. \n  \n \"So please, no one say that he is kidnapped,\" Prince Mohammed said, before turning to Hariri and pumping his hand as the crowd erupted in laughter. \n  \n The summit also drew Dubai's ruler, Jordan's king and Pakistan's prime minister. Pakistan, which is grappling with a soaring deficit, struck a deal on the sidelines of the forum with Saudi Arabia for $6 billion in aid from the oil-rich kingdom. \n  \n Some $55 billion in agreements were signed at the forum, much of that focused on the lucrative Saudi energy industry. Saudi Arabia is one of the world's largest exporters of oil, has the Arab world's largest economy and is a key emerging market. \n  \n Rather than cancel their participation altogether, some companies sent midlevel executives. Outside the hall, hushed conversations over coffee and dates took place, with a flurry of business cards exchanged. \n  \n Several participants from the U.S., including a California hedge fund manager and staff from a U.S. desalination company, declined to speak to the AP, reflecting a general nervousness among the Americans. \n  \n \"This experience has given everyone pause ... to stop, get our breath, take stock and then figure out the most appropriate way forward,\" David Hamod, president and CEO of the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce, told the AP. \n  \n \"At the end of the day, many American companies have stakeholders and shareholders to which they need to be very sensitive. So they will listen to those stakeholders and shareholders,\" Hamod said. \n  \n \"But timing is everything. A fair number of U.S. companies didn't make the trip, as you know, and that's an issue of timing,\" he said, adding that he believes the relationship will be \"very positive\" in the long term. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writer Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Zarar Khan in Islamabad; Malak Harb in Riyadh; and Jan M.

Members of the prince\u2019s security staff are among those named by Turkish authorities as having carried out the killing. \n  \n Profile Jamal Khashoggi Show Hide Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world\u2019s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of Saudi Arabia who has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler. While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and the Guardian. \n  \n His message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws. Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency. He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign. Photograph: Virginia Mayo/AP \n  \n Bin Salman announced a restructuring of the kingdom\u2019s national security agencies and said Saudi Arabia and Turkey would work together \u201cto reach results\u201d. \n  \n \u201cThe incident that happened is very painful, for all Saudis \u2026 The incident is not justifiable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will not be able to divide us as long as there is a king called King Salman bin Abdulaziz and a crown prince named Mohammed bin Salman, and a president in Turkey named Erdo\u011fan.\u201d \n  \n But in a sign that the Saudis\u2019 attempts to address the issue had failed to convince its western allies, No 10 said Theresa May had called King Salman on Wednesday \u201cto reiterate the UK\u2019s grave concerns about the murder\u201d. A Downing Street spokesman said she had told the king that \u201cthe current explanation lacks credibility. She also reiterated that all individuals bearing responsibility for the killing must be properly held to account.\u201d She said suspects would be prevented from entering the UK and any visas would be revoked. \n  \n The crown prince\u2019s remarks were made to a full auditorium of onlookers and guests who listened silently as he responded to a question from a moderator. He distanced himself from the 18 people alleged to have killed and dismembered Khashoggi inside the consulate, and appealed to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, as a partner. On Tuesday, Erdo\u011fan directly accused some of the \u201chighest ranked\u201d Saudis of ordering Khashoggi\u2019s killing, but avoided mentioning Bin Salman by name. \n  \n The prince\u2019s remarks received a short burst of applause and lifted a subdued mood that had heralded his arrival. His entrance had much less fanfare than the inaugural event last year, which had marked the global debut of the 33-year-old heir to the throne. \n  \n \u201cHe\u2019s not going to address the humungous elephant in the room, I bet,\u201d one conference attendee, Heba Saleh, said before the prince\u2019s appearance. Stunned silence met the first mention of Khashoggi\u2019s name, and a palpable relief followed. \n  \n The gruesome killing and its profound implications have cast a pall over the conference, which has been widely boycotted by the international business elite, and partially rescued by regional leaders and last-minute delegations, many of whom have filled seats but pledged little business. American business people are thin on the ground, in stark contrast to 2017, when the halls of the Ritz Carlton conference centre teemed with executives from Fortune 500 companies. \n  \n Some delegates did nothing to hide their disdain for both the crime and the subsequent attempts to cover it up. Four of the alleged killers were members of Bin Salman\u2019s security detail, and the remainder came from the Saudi security establishment. \n  \n \u201cThese idiots have taken us back to the Stone Age,\u201d said one delegate, who refused to be named. \u201cHow do I defend this country to anyone any more? The stupidity here is unparalleled.\u201d \n  \n Others said attempts to quarantine Bin Salman from an act blamed on his closest personal staff, including his domestic enforcer, Saud al-Qahtani, were doomed to backfire. \u201cIt suits many of us to believe this, because the alternative is just too impossible,\u201d said a Saudi businessman who called himself Ahmed Mohammed. \u201cBut anyone who has lived here understands the fiction. And his friends outside cannot be expected to look away like us.\u201d \n  \n Khaled Mansour, another Saudi businessman, said the country had little option but to fall in behind Bin Salman, and that holding senior leaders to account for Khashoggi\u2019s death would set the country back further. \u201cThis is very complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is painful for the family and for the people. It is best to live in denial here.\u201d \n  \n On Tuesday, Donald Trump, an ally of Bin Salman, said for the first time that the prince could have been involved in the operation to kill the dissident Saudi journalist. \u201cWell, the prince is running things over there, more so at this stage. He\u2019s running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him,\u201d he said. \n  \n On Wednesday, the Washington Post added to reports in Turkish media that CIA director Gina Haspel had listened to an audio recording said to prove Khashoggi was brutally tortured before his premeditated murder. Haspel flew to Ankara on Monday night to assist Turkey\u2019s investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death. Four sources familiar with the mission brief told Reuters she had asked to view the tapes. \n  \n Play Video 0:45 'Worst cover-up ever': Trump on apparent Khashoggi murder plot \u2013 video \n  \n The Saudi monarch, King Salman, in addition to May, spoke to Erdo\u011fan on Wednesday, a day after the Turkish leader appealed to him to solve a festering crisis between the two regional power bases. An adviser to Erdo\u011fan said the young prince had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d over Khashoggi. Turkish officials have suggested that they will release more information incriminating the Saudi state if King Salman does not move against the son he anointed as his heir 17 months ago. \n  \n Known for convictions that critics describe as brazen arrogance, Bin Salman struck several conciliatory tones during his appearance, the first towards archfoe Qatar, which Saudi Arabia has boycotted for more than a year. \u201cEven though we have our differences with Qatar, in five years\u2019 time they will be in a very different place,\u201d he said. The comments were the first cracks in an unwavering hostility towards the small Gulf state. \n  \n More visibly, the Lebanese prime minister, Sadd Hariri \u2013 who was summoned to Riyadh by Bin Salman 11 months ago, then briefly detained \u2013 was sitting alongside him on the stage. It marked a remarkable reversal of fortunes for a man who had been discarded as a Saudi ally and forced to sign over local assets. \n  \n \u201cSaad Hariri will be here for two more days,\u201d Bin Salman said. \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone say he\u2019s been kidnapped. ||||| ISTANBUL (Reuters) - An adviser to Turkey\u2019s leader said on Wednesday Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince had \u201cblood on his hands\u201d over Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s killing, the bluntest comments yet from someone linked to Tayyip Erdogan about Riyadh\u2019s de facto ruler in connection with the death. \n  \n Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the remarks. \n  \n Riyadh has blamed a \u201crogue operation\u201d for the death of the prominent Saudi journalist, and said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had no knowledge of the killing. \n  \n Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, disappeared on Oct. 2 when he visited the consulate to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage. After weeks of denying any knowledge of his whereabouts, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi was killed in a fistfight in the consulate. \n  \n The kingdom\u2019s shifting explanations have met incredulity internationally and stirred deepening criticism from Turkey and the West. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Saudi authorities staged the \u201cworst cover-up ever\u201d. \n  \n \u201cIt is a disgrace that reaches all the way to Crown Prince (Mohammed bin) Salman. At least five members of the execution team are (Mohammed bin) Salman\u2019s right hands and are people that wouldn\u2019t act without his knowledge,\u201d Ilnur Cevik, an adviser to President Erdogan, wrote in a column in the Yeni Birlik newspaper. \n  \n \u201cEven if U.S. President Trump saves (Mohammed bin) Salman, in the eyes of the world he is a questionable person with Khashoggi\u2019s blood on his hands,\u201d Cevik wrote. \n  \n Cevik is one of many Erdogan advisers and not a prominent one. It was not immediately clear whether the views of the column reflected those of Erdogan, who in speeches on Tuesday and Wednesday highlighted the need for all of those responsible - \u201cfrom those who ordered it to those who carried it out\u201d - to face justice. \n  \n Riyadh has detained 18 people and dismissed five senior government officials as part of an investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s death. One of those fired includes Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to the crown prince. |||||"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

Two Americans, Fowle and Matthew Todd Miller, charged with \u201canti-state\u201d... (Associated Press) \n  \n In their first appearance since being detained more than three months ago, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle told a local AP Television News crew that they were in good health and were being treated well. They also said they were allowed to take daily walks. The brief meeting was conducted under the condition that the specific location not be disclosed. \n  \n Fowle said he fears his situation will get much worse once he goes on trial. \n  \n \"The horizon for me is pretty dark,\" he said. \"I don't know what the worst-case scenario would be, but I need help to extricate myself from this situation. I ask the government for help in that regards.\" \n  \n It was not clear whether they were speaking on their own initiative, or if their comments were coerced. The TV crew was permitted to ask them questions. \n  \n North Korea says the two committed hostile acts which violated their status as tourists. It has announced that authorities are preparing to bring them before a court, but has not yet specified what they did that was considered hostile or illegal, or what kind of punishment they might face. The date of the trial has not been announced. \n  \n Ri Tong II, a North Korean diplomat, declined to answer questions about the Americans at a news conference Friday at the United Nations. But when pressed in a follow-up question he said their cases were \"legal issues\" and they had \"violated our law.\" \n  \n Fowle arrived in North Korea on April 29. He is suspected of leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin, but a spokesman for Fowle's family said the 56-year-old from Miamisburg, Ohio, was not on a mission for his church. Fowle works in a city streets department. He has a wife and three children, ages 9, 10, and 12. \n  \n \"The window is closing on that process. It will be coming relatively soon, maybe within a month,\" Fowle said of his trial. \"I'm anxious to get home, I'm sure all of us are.\" \n  \n Fowle also produced a letter he said he had written summarizing his experience in North Korea. \n  \n The attorney for Fowle's family said Friday his wife hadn't seen the video, but had read news reports about his comments. \n  \n \"I can tell you that she is very upset, as you can imagine,\" said attorney Timothy Tepe. He said he and the family were still gathering information and likely would have a statement on Monday. \n  \n Less is known about Miller, or about what specific crime he allegedly committed. \n  \n North Korea's state-run media have said the 24-year-old entered the country April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum. A large number of Western tourists visited Pyongyang in April to run in the annual Pyongyang Marathon or attend related events. Miller came at that time, but tour organizers say he was not planning to join the marathon. \n  \n \"I expect soon I will be going to trial for my crime and be sent to prison,\" Miller said. \"I have been requesting help from the American government, but have received no reply.\" \n  \n A handwritten note on the front door of his family's home in California asked for privacy. \n  \n Neighbor Carol Stewart said Miller first traveled to South Korea about four years ago to visit a brother stationed there with the U.S. Air Force. He found work teaching English and learned Korean, Stewart said in a July 1 interview. She has since declined to comment out of respect for his parents' wishes. \n  \n \"He liked it a lot, and he's been there ever since,\" said Stewart, describing Miller as the shy one of the four brothers. \n  \n North Korea has also been holding another American, Kenneth Bae, since November 2012. \n  \n Bae, a Korean-American missionary who turned 46 on Friday, told a Japan-based pro-North Korean news organization earlier this week that he felt \"abandoned\" by the U.S. government. He is serving a sentence of 15 years of hard labor for what North Korea has claimed were hostile acts against the state. However, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday the agency is in regular contact with Bae's family. \n  \n Last summer, authorities moved Bae from a work camp to a hospital because of failing health and weight loss. He was sent back to the work camp earlier this year, only to be taken again to a hospital less than two months later. His family says he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liver problems and back pain. \n  \n Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said in a statement Thursday it was the first word the family has had of Bae since April. \n  \n \"After months of silence, it is devastating to hear Kenneth talk about 'feeling abandoned by the United States government,'\" she said. \"Although we acknowledge and appreciate all the efforts the U.S. State Department has been making behind the scenes to secure Kenneth's release, the fact remains that after almost two years, Kenneth still remains imprisoned in North Korea.\" \n  \n North Korea has in the past waited for senior U.S. officials to come to the country to secure the release of some American detainees. Both Fowle and Miller suggested that intervention from the highest levels in Washington \u2014 possibly a visit by a former president \u2014 might be needed to gain their release. \n  \n The U.S. has repeatedly offered to send its envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert King, to Pyongyang to seek a pardon for Bae and other U.S. detainees but without success. \n  \n Washington has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and no embassy in Pyongyang. Instead, the Swedish Embassy takes responsibility for U.S. consular affairs there. \n  \n Though a small number of U.S. citizens visit North Korea each year as tourists, the State Department strongly advises against it. After Miller's detention, Washington updated its travel warning to note that over the past 18 months, \"North Korea detained several U.S. citizens who were part of organized tours.\" \n  \n North Korea has been strongly pushing tourism lately in an effort to bring in foreign cash. But despite its efforts to bring in more visitors \u2014 mostly from neighboring China \u2014 it remains highly sensitive to any actions it considers political and is particularly wary of anything it deems to be Christian proselytizing. \n  \n In March, North Korea deported an Australian missionary detained for spreading Christianity in the country after he apologized and requested forgiveness. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writers Trenton Daniel at the United Nations; Dan Sewell in Cincinnati, Ohio; and Scott Smith and Matt Hamilton in Bakersfield, California, contributed to this report. ||||| Two US tourists being held in North Korea have called on the US government to help secure their release from the isolated country, in an interview with the Associated Press Television Network. \n  \n North Korea has said Matthew Miller and Jeffrey Fowle, held since early May, would be put on trial for crimes against the state. \n  \n \"I am now requesting help from the American government, the citizens of America and the world to release me from this situation,\" Mr Miller, 24, from Bakersfield, California, said in the interview, recorded in Pyongyang on Friday. \n  \n The video also showed a handwritten letter from Mr Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg, Ohio, that said he was arrested for leaving a bible at a site visited by his tour group in the northern city of Chongjin. \n  \n \"I feel a great urgency to get back to my family! Please help me come back home!,\" the letter said. \n  \n Mr Fowle said of the letter: \"My aim is to get that message out to as many people who can hear it, to help us come home.\" \n  \n Both men were talking to someone off camera.

One victim was transported to Lubbock, and several others were released from Midland Memorial late Thursday evening, said Chief Price Robinson, of the Midland Police Department. Marcy Madrid, a Midland Memorial spokesperson, told the Reporter-Telegram late Thursday that of the 16 injured admitted to Midland Memorial, 10 were treated and released, four were in stable condition, one was in critical condition and the other was transported to Lubbock. The victims\u2019 names were not released. \n  \n A float carrying veterans and their spouses in the ninth annual Show of Support parade was struck by an eastbound train about 4:36 p.m. near the corner of Garfield Street and Industrial Avenue, Robinson said. \n  \n The parade was taking 24 veterans and their spouses from the DoubleTree by Hilton to the Horseshoe in south Midland. \n  \n According to officials, the trailer hit was the second of two carrying veterans near the end of the parade route. The first trailer already had crossed the train tracks. \n  \n The trailer was carrying 26 passengers \u2014 12 veterans, 12 spouses and two civilian escorts \u2014 Robinson said. \n  \n Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter said the trailer was almost across the tracks when the train struck it. \n  \n \u201cIt was pandemonium at the point of impact. Some (of the veterans) tried to jump and protect each other, their girlfriends and their wives,\u201d he said. \n  \n Authorities at the scene were going through the roster at 6 p.m. to account for everyone involved. \n  \n In 2003, the speed limit for trains traveling through Midland increased from 40 to 60 miles per hour. \n  \n Officials with Union Pacific at the time said speed increases bring effectiveness to motorists who don\u2019t have to wait at railroad crossings as long, while helping trains move along faster and more efficiently. \n  \n Union Pacific spokesman Tom Lange said the eastbound train was sounding its horn before it hit the float Thursday as it approached the railroad crossing. He said the crossing gate and lights were working at the time. \n  \n Lange didn\u2019t know if the train crew saw the float approaching. \n  \n Officials would not comment on if the driver will face any charges or what caused the wreck, saying the crash was still under investigation. The Associated Press reported that the National Transportation Safety Board is in charge of the investigation, but Robinson said at a press conference Thursday night that MPD was investigating the wreck. \n  \n Painter, a veteran himself, said that Midland suffered a severe tragedy Thursday. \n  \n \u201cI am very hurt and very shocked. My emotions are running pretty high,\u201d he said. \u201cOur feelings and thoughts are going out to all the people.\u201d \n  \n Show of Support officials scrambled to find private transportation for wounded individuals and their families who were not from Midland. Directors said they planned to establish an account at Western National Bank to provide for the families\u2019 needs. \n  \n The parade was supposed to lead up to the Hunt for Heroes banquet. Wounded servicemen were supposed to be treated to an all-expenses paid white tail deer hunting trip this weekend, and their spouses would be treated to a variety of activities in Midland. \n  \n All Show of Support events have been canceled, said Terry Johnson, the organization\u2019s president and founder. \n  \n Earlier that day, the servicemen were treated to a luncheon at the Commemorative Air Force. State Sen. Kel Seliger and Mayor Wes Perry spoke at the luncheon. \n  \n \u201cI\u2019m just sick; I\u2019m sick to my stomach,\u201d said Perry, who gave each man a key to the city at the luncheon. \u201cThey\u2019re heroes; they\u2019re the best of the best. I was honored to be in their presence.\u201d \n  \n Clergy and other volunteers arrived at the DoubleTree, where the families were staying, late into the night to provide support after the accident. Many said they had heard the news and stopped by to see if they could be of assistance. \n  \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect Midland to act any other way,\u201d said Donny McClure, a Show of Support director. \u201cThis is a time when the entire community, state and country comes together to pray for families who are in need beyond description.\u201d ||||| A freight train slammed into a parade float carrying wounded veterans on Thursday, killing four people and injuring 17 others as the float tried to get through a West Texas railroad crossing on its way to an honorary banquet, authorities said. \n  \n Bystanders react as emergency personnel work the scene where a trailer carrying wounded veterans in a parade was struck by a train in Midland, Texas, Thursday, Nov. 15, 2012. \"Show of Support\" president...

It is named after songwriting brothers George and Ira Gershwin. \n  \n King, now 70, topped the charts with the song \u201cIt\u2019s Too Late\u201d in 1971, but is best known for her work performed by others, including \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d by James Taylor and \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d by Aretha Franklin. \n  \n \u201cI was so pleased when the venerable Library of Congress began honoring writers of popular songs with the Gershwin Prize,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be the fifth such honoree and the first woman among such distinguished company.\u201d \n  \n King and Goffin wrote some the biggest hits of the 1960s before their nine-year marriage ended in 1968. They rose to prominence in 1960 writing \u201cWill You Love Me Tomorrow\u201d for the Shirelles. \n  \n The duo also scored hits with \u201cTake Good Care of My Baby,\u201d performed by Bobby Vee in 1961, \u201cThe Loco-Motion,\u201d performed by Little Eva in 1962 and \u201cPleasant Valley Sunday,\u201d performed by The Monkees in 1967, among others. \n  \n New York-born King did not hit it big as a singer until 1971, when \u201cTapestry\u201d topped the U.S. album charts for 15 weeks, then a record for a female solo artist. \n  \n Past recipients of the award include Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney and songwriting tandem Burt Bacharach and Hal David. ||||| Carole King, right, joined by Alicia Keys at a recent salute in Hollywood to King's music, will receive the Library of Congress' 2013 Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.

Billington said in a statement accompanying the announcement. \u201cFor more than five decades, she has written for and been recorded by many different types of artists for a wide range of audiences, communicating with beauty and dignity the universal human emotions of love, joy, pain and loss. Her body of work reflects the spirit of the Gershwin Prize with its originality, longevity and diversity of appeal.\u201d \n  \n In the same statement, King said, \u201cI was so pleased when the venerable Library of Congress began honoring writers of popular songs with the Gershwin Prize.

(Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images / ) \n  \n WASHINGTON \u2014 As he launches his second term, President Obama may get help from an ambitious new political organization being built out of his reelection campaign, a group that could reshape how future presidents harness supporters to press their White House agendas. \n  \n Run by former Obama campaign officials, the advocacy group will seek to leverage the campaign's sophisticated organizing tools and rich voter database to support the president's policy objectives, including raising the debt ceiling, gun control and immigration reform. \n  \n If it is able to sustain the passion that propelled Obama twice into the White House, the pro-Obama group may outstrip the role played by traditional interest groups, from organized labor to the environmental movement, and could form an independent power base outside the White House and the Democratic Party. \n  \n \"This just dwarfs any part of the Democratic coalition,\" said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi. \"This is the biggest leg of the stool. There are really significant implications in terms of the permanent power center within the party.\" \n  \n Although details of the group's structure \u2014 and its name \u2014 may be released Friday, the launch is set for Sunday, when 4,000 former campaign staff and volunteers are expected at a Washington hotel for a daylong event dubbed the Obama Campaign Legacy Conference. Thousands of supporters are expected to watch online. \n  \n PHOTOS: President Obama\u2019s past \n  \n Even before its launch, Republicans described the group's resources as a threat. \n  \n \"Obama, who's not going to be running for reelection, has an enormous database, a lot of political muscle, a machine, that I believe he intends to focus squarely on the House,\" Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters Thursday at the House Republican Conference retreat in Williamsburg, Va. \"So we have our work cut out for us.\" \n  \n A similar effort fizzled after Obama first won the White House. In 2009, Obama campaign organizers also hoped to use its database, millions of email addresses and a corps of trained operatives to help push White House goals. But Organizing for America \u2014 then housed within the Democratic National Committee \u2014 played a limited role during the bitter debate over Obama's healthcare overhaul, which barely squeaked through Congress. \n  \n Obama's volunteer network was remobilized in the 2012 race, when the campaign used social media and other technology to connect supporters to their neighbors and friends. Supporters donated a record $1.1 billion \u2014 including $216 million in contributions of $200 or less, according to the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. \n  \n Leadership for the new group has not been announced, but former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and several other former campaign operatives are expected to play key roles. On Thursday, Messina sent out an email blast to Obama campaign supporters urging them to back the White House gun policy proposals. \n  \n Making the leap from a campaign built around the singular goal to one with a broader \u2014 and ongoing \u2014 mission is no easy task. \n  \n QUIZ: How much do you know about presidential inaugurations? \n  \n \"Every presidential campaign struggles with the question of, 'How do we handle our legacy?'\" noted Republican election law attorney Michael Toner, who served as general counsel for George W. Bush's 2000 campaign. \"This is fairly novel, and it's rare to talk about trying to house this apart from the party. I think it's very challenging, because the DNC will say, 'What about us?' Other candidates will say, 'What about us?' It's very hard to finesse that.\" \n  \n The organization will be set up as a 501(c)4 social welfare group, according to top Democrats privy to the discussions. That structure allows it to accept unlimited contributions. \n  \n But rolling over the assets of a presidential campaign into a tax-exempt advocacy group presents some legal challenges. Campaign finance lawyers noted that such an organization cannot have politics as its primary purpose, according to Internal Revenue Service regulations. \n  \n Such groups also are not required to publicly disclose their donors, a practice that Obama repeatedly deplored as he fielded attack ads in the 2012 campaign from 501(c)4 organizations such as Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity. The pro-Obama group could voluntarily reveal its contributors, however. \n  \n It's unclear what relationship the new group will have with the Democratic National Committee, which runs the party. As a 501(c)4, it will face restrictions on coordinating with political committees. \n  \n The Obama campaign's data files \u2014 its most valuable assets \u2014 may be housed in a separate legal entity that would make them accessible to Democratic candidates and party committees, according to a source familiar with the plans. \n  \n Officials with the campaign and the DNC did not return calls for comment. |||||"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

Rorke Himself \n  \n CIA agent Roselyn Sanchez \n  \n  \n  \n Relativity Media presents a film directed by Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh. Written by Kurt Johnstad. Running time: 101 minutes. Rated R (for strong violence including some torture, and for language). Printer-friendly \u00bb \n  \n E-mail this to a friend \u00bb \n  \n \"Act of Valor\" contains hard-hitting combat footage, relentless and effective. There is a story behind the film that is no less engrossing. In an introduction, its co-directors, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, speak directly to the audience, describing how they got involved in a film about the Navy SEALs, how they were embedded with an actual SEAL unit \u2014 and how, when that project grew into a fiction film, they determined to use real SEALs and not professional actors. \n  \n The early version of the film, according to reporting by Rebecca Keegan of the Los Angeles Times, was variously intended as a training or recruitment film, and was made outside the usual Department of Defense guidelines for motion pictures. It now emerges as a thriller involving two (non-factual) scenarios, one about a SEALs mission to free a kidnapped CIA operative (Roselyn Sanchez), the other about a plot to smuggle terrorists into the United States through tunnels from Mexico constructed by drug cartels. \n  \n  \n  \n The details in both of these scenarios seem realistic \u2014 although how would I know? The co-directors and their team have produced an accomplished, riveting action movie. I am reminded of the initial impact of films like Oliver Stone's \"Platoon\" and Kathryn Bigelow's \"The Hurt Locker,\" which both told convincing and authentic stories. \"Act of Valor,\" however, centers more on action and much less on the human elements involved. \n  \n  \n  \n The central characters are played by actual Navy SEALs, who were apparently on active duty during the filming and still are. This makes it difficult to write the ordinary kind of review, because none of their real names are revealed and indeed some of the characters seem to have no names at all. I learn from Rebecca Keegan's article that the characters named Chief Dave and Lt. Rorke are played by SEALs whose real first names are Dave and Rorke. Thanks a lot. The official cast listing is a baffling mixture of characters without names and names with \"uncredited\" roles, and doesn't include either Chief Dave and Lt. Rorke, so I am reduced to describing the experience and not the performances. \n  \n  \n  \n Much of the movie consists of pure action, punctuated by terse dialogue and few subtleties. We don't get to know the characters as individuals, they don't have personality traits, they have no back stories, they don't speak in colorful dialogue, and after the movie you'd find yourself describing events but not people. Assuming that the characters described as SEALs were being played by real SEALs, all I can say is that they were convincing and weren't asked to do any dramatic stretching they weren't capable of. \n  \n  \n  \n Yet the movie can be discussed on another level. In the same week I saw \"Act of Valor,\" I also saw an extraordinary film named \"Hell and Back Again.\" It's one of this year's Oscar nominees for best documentary feature, and will open in many markets on the same day as \"Act of Valor.\" It is about a real man, Marine Sgt. Nathan Harris, and his real wife, Ashley. Harris led men in combat in Afghanistan. Shortly before the scheduled end of his six-month tour, a sniper's bullet entered his right buttock, shattered his hip socket and bounced back to destroy leg bones. He's quite willing to show people the entry scar and describe how he has two rods filling in for bones. \n  \n  \n  \n When Nathan Harris was a teenager, he says, \"What I wanted to do was kill people.\" He enlisted in the Marines. He doesn't actually say if he has killed anyone or not, but the director, Danfung Dennis, who was embedded with Harris' Echo Company, followed him in action, and we see that he has grown into a natural leader of men. Some of the film's most involving scenes show him debating village elders (through an interpreter) about the role of America in Afghanistan; he sincerely believes he is helping to bring them freedom, and finds it hard to answer their statements that they want to be left alone by both the Americans and the Taliban. \n  \n  \n  \n The film follows Harris home, through an agonizing period of rehab and shows that his life will never be the same. Memories of battle haunt him, and \"Hell and Back Again\" intercuts actual sights and scenes from Afghanistan with scenes back home in North Carolina. He doesn't have post-traumatic stress syndrome. He dreams of returning to action, and it is hard for him to accept that it may not happen. \n  \n  \n  \n \"Act of Valor\" is gift-wrapped in patriotism. It was once intended as a recruitment film, and that's how it plays. The action scenes are harrowing but exciting. Lots of explosions and special effects. At the end, there is a full-dress military funeral, honoring three generations of warriors. The real action scenes in \"Hell and Back Again\" don't play like an action movie. I don't recall seeing a single Taliban fighter. One of Sgt. Harris' men is killed on the first day in the field. Harris is wounded late in his tour. Nobody saw either one of the snipers. \n  \n  \n  \n I have a feeling that the teenage Nathan Harris, who wanted to kill people, would have loved \"Act of Valor.\" But \"Hell and Back Again,\" in describing his life today, doesn't play like a recruitment film. A great deal is made by the directors McCoy and Waugh that actual live ammunition was used in the making of their film. Actual live ammunition was also used in \"Hell and Back Again.\" If you asked Sgt. Nathan Harris what he thought about using live ammo in a Hollywood action movie, what do you suppose he would say? My best guess is, he would say they were damned fools. ||||| Honor, Courage, Commitment, Popcorn: Act of Valor Wants You \n  \n Act of Valor is, according to the opening titles, \"based on real acts of valor,\" whatever that means. It stars real active-duty Navy SEALs, and, as the uniformed representative of the New York Coast Guard, 9th Regiment who introduced my screening explained, much of it was filmed with live-fire ammunition. \n  \n None of the above works to strengthen the muddled movie's dramatic narrative, but the film's boasted authenticity\u2014including cameos from the latest in military hardware\u2014and its closing dedication \"to all the warriors headed downrange in the future\" make clear the aim: This is the most lavish recruiting tool the armed forces have deployed to theaters in memory, besting that pre-movie commercial with the \"freedom ain't so free\" Kid Rock soundtrack a few years back. \n  \n The SEAL actors go uncredited, but at the center of Act of Valor are \"Chief Dave\" and \"Lieutenant Commander Rorke,\" two minimally charismatic studs who compete to deliver lines in the deepest bass-baritone. (You can remember which is which only because one of them keeps a toothpick in the corner of his mouth.) \n  \n After a suicide bombing at the International School in Jakarta, Dave, Rorke, and the cursorily introduced members of their team must deploy to the likes of Costa Rica, the Sudan, and Mexico to follow the border-hopping conspiracy of a jihadist network led by a Ukrainian-born convert to Islam, Abul Shabal (Jason Cottle), arranging to purchase the latest in suicide-bomb technology from his boyhood friend, an arms dealer (Alex Veadov). \n  \n Despite that setup, the villains come across as individuals rather more compellingly than do the film's ostensible heroes, mostly mouthpieces for warrior credo recited in voiceover (\"No one is more dangerous than a man who can harness his emotions,\" etc.). This is the prose of 300 co-screenwriter Kurt Johnstad, again showing his obvious reverence for martial values, though this time without a mythological visual analogue. The workaday soldier's dialogue heard here has, one suspects, the same relation to the real thing as the network-television mic'd talk of football players does to an actual, unobserved huddle. \n  \n You might argue that individual faces don't matter here, as individuals aren't the heroes of Act of Valor so much as is the organization, the unit. But if this is an homage to teamwork, it's no great shakes at clarifying how a team works. The combat footage, meant to show the unit working in tandem, was shot in large part with helmet-mounted cameras, a POV familiar to the film's targeted demographic from tactical first-person-shooter video games. This obscures any broader understanding of physical relationships for an \"immersive\" cacophony of first-person perspectives: More than any cinematic precedent, Act of Valor most closely resembles the latest upgrade of America's Army, the multiplayer recruitment-drive game launched by the U.S. military in 2002. \n  \n The film's first set piece is the best, a personnel-recovery mission that breaks away into a parallel-action chase capped by a gunboat pulling around a bend in the river, mini-gun erupting, with the fanfare of arriving cavalry. But that basic tactical clarity otherwise escapes Act of Valor: It's all about you-are-there adrenaline injections, a string of jolts to work up an appetite for the real thing. |||||"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\". Your task is to summarize them.", "input": "Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes hopes to topple Mitch McConnell. (Associated Press) \n  \n With Congress gearing up for the August recess, Mitch McConnell can focus on his reelection campaign in Bluegrass State. It looks like the Senate minority leader will have his work cut out for him. \n  \n McConnell faces fights on two fronts in his quest for reelection. First, businessman Matt Bevin announced a primary challenge from the right last week. Bevin's an underdog, but he's got the backing of influential conservatives including Erick Erickson, and as we learned in 2010, longstanding GOP senators can't take reelection for granted these days. Rand Paul also upset establishment pick Trey Grayson in the 2010 primary for the other U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky. \n  \n Assuming McConnell knocks off Bevin, however, he'll face a second challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state. A poll by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, conducted for the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Democracy for America and out this morning, suggests Grimes will give McConnell a run for his money. Not only is the senator's approval underwater, he also trails Grimes head-to-head: \n  \n Do you approve or disapprove of the way Republican Mitch McConnell is handling his job as U.S. Senator? \n  \n  \n  \n Approve .............................. ............................ 40% \n  \n Disapprove.................... .............................. .... 51% \n  \n No opinion....................... .............................. .. 9% \n  \n (Asked of 1,210 Kentucky voters MOE 2.8%) \n  \n  \n  \n If the general election for U.S. Senate were held today, and the choices were Republican Mitch McConnell and Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, for whom would you vote? Mitch McConnell .............................. ............... 44% \n  \n Alison Lundergan Grimes .............................. . 45% \n  \n Undecided..................... .............................. .... 11% \n  \n (Asked of 1,210 Kentucky voters MOE 2.8%) \n  \n That follows on previous polls that showed a tight race, though previous ones have never shown her leading. In April, PPP found McConnell leading Grimes 45-41, while a late May poll by the same firm found them tied up at 45. PPP had a stellar record in 2012, despite their partisan affiliation. On the other hand, it's well within the margin of error, and a Republican firm found McConnell up eight points, 48-40, just last week. But this is the first poll since Grimes' official campaign launch. Her soft launch was widely derided -- when she announced she would run, Grimes didn't even have a website -- but she held a formal event to jump into the race Wednesday. Back on July 1, Nate Silver examined the race and found McConnell a favorite but not a slam dunk for reelection. But Grimes has the potential to be a formidable candidate, as Dave Catanese pointed out here earlier this month. Though she's only run for office once, she upset a Democratic incumbent and sailed to victory, and her father is a powerhouse in state circles -- and a friend of Bill Clinton's. Poll numbers like this only reinforce how serious McConnell's challenge is. ||||| McConnell leads Bevin by almost 40 points, and Grimes by 8 points, the poll finds. | AP Photos Poll: McConnell leads Bevin, Grimes \n  \n A fresh Republican poll shows Mitch McConnell crushing his GOP primary challenger and comfortably leading his Democratic opponent in Kentucky. \n  \n The Wenzel Strategies survey, in the field Tuesday and Wednesday nights, puts the Senate minority leader ahead of Matt Bevin by almost 40 points, 59 percent to 20 percent, among Republican primary voters. The rest said they are undecided. \n  \n Story Continued Below \n  \n Bevin, a wealthy Louisville businessman who announced his candidacy Wednesday, is largely undefined. He is viewed positively by 15 percent of respondents and negatively by 21 percent; two-thirds of voters indicated that they don\u2019t have an opinion. \n  \n ( QUIZ: How well do you know Mitch McConnell?) \n  \n This makes Bevin vulnerable to the blistering attacks that McConnell already has unleashed to challenge his conservative bona fides. \n  \n McConnell leads Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes by 8 points, 48 percent to 40 percent, with 12 percent undecided. This is essentially unchanged from a survey they conducted a month ago. \n  \n Almost everyone has a view on the 28-year Senate veteran. In the poll, he is viewed favorably by 53 percent and unfavorably by 46 percent. Forty-one percent said they will definitely vote to reelect him, and 39 percent said they will definitely vote for someone else. Twenty percent said they will consider others besides McConnell. \n  \n ( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014) \n  \n One-quarter of voters still have no opinion of Grimes, whose father is a former chairman of the state Democratic Party. She\u2019s seen favorably by 35 percent and unfavorably by 41 percent. A month ago, she was seen unfavorably by only 25 percent. \n  \n \u201cMy sense is that Kentucky voters are not excited about what they see so far in her candidacy but seem to be willing to give her at least one more look before passing an electoral judgment,\u201d pollster Fritz Wenzel wrote in a memo accompanying the numbers, which were obtained exclusively by POLITICO. \n  \n Rand Paul, whom Wenzel polls for, appears to be the most popular politician in the state. The junior senator, who has endorsed McConnell, is viewed favorably by 61 percent. Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear is seen favorably by 56 percent. \n  \n The statewide telephone survey included 624 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percent. \n  \n Looking at the Republican primary, 27 percent said they could change their mind and 15 percent said they are \u201cvery open\u201d to changing their mind. But 58 percent described themselves as \u201cvery firm\u201d about whom they will support. \n  \n If Bevin\u2019s long-shot primary bid succeeded, he would narrowly lead Grimes, 35 percent to 30 percent. But the plurality of voters are undecided. |||||"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given a text of many news articles seperated by special token \"|||||\".

The 79-year-old said it was \u201cdisgusting\u201d that there were no lifeguards. \n  \n Jane Walker, 26, from south London, went swimming in the sea off Camber Sands on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s awful what happened, obviously, but we\u2019re not swimming out far and we\u2019ve been down here a few times before so know the area,\u201d she said. \n  \n Walker said she was shocked by the deaths of the five men. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when we found out the day before we were coming down. It\u2019s really sad. Five is so many it makes you wonder what could have gone wrong.\u201d \n  \n She added: \u201cI am really surprised there are no lifeguards. In fact, I don\u2019t think I ever noticed that before. That\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s such a long beach and it can get so busy.\u201d \n  \n The RNLI said that while it was too early to determine any change in the location of its lifeguards, the policy was under constant review and Wednesday\u2019s events would be factored into the charity\u2019s planning. \n  \n A spokesperson for Rother district council said: \u201cWe are very saddened to hear of this incident and our thoughts are with the families of those involved. \n  \n \u201cRegular assessments are carried out at Camber beach, along with the RNLI, to inform what measures need to be taken to guide visitor safety and ensure the beach is safe. To date this has not identified the need for lifeguards to be deployed at the beach and there have never been lifeguards employed at the beach.\u201d \n  \n The RNLI has urged seaside visitors to take care and respect the water after Wednesday\u2019s incident brought the number of deaths around Britain\u2019s coastline in the past week up to 12. \u201cThe sea may look appealing and the RNLI would encourage people to use it, but do so safely \u2013 it can be dangerously unpredictable,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \n  \n Additional reporting by Damien Gayle ||||| Police officers on Camber Sands near Rye, East Sussex, England, after three men died after being pulled from the sea on the hottest day of the year, Wednesday Aug. 24, 2016.

Your task is to summarize them.", "input": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- The Arizona Cardinals' hiring of Jen Welter, who is believed to be the first female NFL coach, shouldn't be a surprise. \n  \n Not in the least, especially when you look at who made it. \n  \n Cardinals coach Bruce Arians showed his hand in March at the NFL owners meetings, when he, unprompted, brought up the idea of female coaches in the NFL. He said he was asked when a female would be hired. His response was: \u201cThe minute they can prove they can make a player better, they'll be hired.\u201d It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see the ball was already rolling. \n  \n This is a typical Arians move. It\u2019s risky and it\u2019s bold, just like his offense. If it works, Arians will look like a genius. And a trendsetter. If it works, it's because Welter is in the right place with the right coach. Hiring Welter takes an open mind and thick skin. Arians has both. Football is widely considered to be a tight-knit fraternity. \n  \n Arians knows this well; at 62, he\u2019s been around the game a while. There might be a faction that chastises him for making the fraternity coed. Some will call Welter\u2019s hiring a publicity stunt. But Arians will let all that roll off his shoulders. He\u2019s used to ignoring the naysayers, having been passed up for a NFL head coaching job until he was 60. \n  \n Arians is progressive and nontraditional. All it takes is one look to know Arians thinks outside the box. He wears trendy eyeglasses and stylish jeans and shirts, and he tops it off with his signature driving hat. And just look at his coaching staff. For the last two years, it was a mix of young and old, black and white, experienced and inexperienced. The Cardinals have three assistants who are 70 or older. One pass rush specialist, Tom Pratt, turned 80 this summer. \n  \n While most head coaches are looking for the next young gun to hire, Arians went looking for coaches who could teach, regardless of their age or gender. He valued their brains over their birth certificates. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not surprising he brought in Welter. \n  \n Welter fits right in. She\u2019s experienced, having played professional football in a women\u2019s league for 14 years before playing a season in a men\u2019s league. She also coached men for a season before being hired by the Cardinals. She has been described to me as a football junkie who loves to study and knows the game inside and out. \n  \n But there\u2019s another reason why this hiring is so very Arians: He doesn\u2019t mind playing rookies. A couple of years ago it was defensive back Tyrann Mathieu. Last season, it was wide receiver John Brown. Arians' teams have thrived the past few years in part because of it. If he thinks they\u2019re good enough, Arians has no qualms about giving rookies a shot. That\u2019s what he\u2019s doing with Welter during training camp and the preseason. Now it\u2019s up to her to prove Arians was right. ||||| During the owners meetings in March at the Arizona Biltmore, someone asked Bruce Arians about the possibility of female coaches in the NFL. \n  \n \u201cThe minute they can prove they can make a player better, they\u2019ll be hired,\u201d Arians said, noting that\u2019s all any player ever really wants. \n  \n It was soon after that Arians heard from the coach of the Texas Revolution in the Indoor Football League, who told Arians the Revolution already had a female on its staff that would be worth a look. Monday, Arians brought in Jen Welter \u2013 the one-time collegiate rugby player who played 14 seasons of pro football, mostly in the Women\u2019s Football Alliance \u2013 as a training camp/preseason intern coaching inside linebackers. Welter is believed to be the first woman to hold a coaching position of any kind in the NFL. \n  \n \u201cCoaching is nothing more than teaching,\u201d Arians said Monday. \u201cOne thing I have learned from players is, \u2018How are you going to make me better? If you can make me better, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re the Green Hornet, man, I\u2019ll listen.\u2019 I really believe she\u2019ll have a great opportunity with this internship through training camp to open some doors for her.\u201d \n  \n Welter wasn\u2019t the only addition to the staff. Former Pro Bowl linebacker Levon Kirkland will work with outside linebackers for the next two seasons under the Bill Bidwill Coaching Fellowship, a new program designed to help recently retired players gain experience in coaching. \n  \n Kirkland, who played 11 NFL seasons with the Steelers, Seahawks and Eagles, spent the offseason as a Cardinals\u2019 coaching intern. Arians said because colleges and the NFL start training camps about the same time, the window for interns who work on the college level \u2013 like those who come through the Bill Walsh minority coaching fellowship \u2013 is too tight. Retired players who want to get into coaching have the ability to work with a team longer. \n  \n \u201cI approached Michael (Bidwill) about starting a fellowship and naming it after his dad, who is a pioneer in a lot of ways,\u201d Arians said. \n  \n Bidwill, who was honored for promoting diversity in the NFL by the Fritz Pollard Alliance in 2010, was the first owner to hire an African American female executive when Adele Harris was named the team\u2019s director of community relations in 1978. Bidwill also made Bob Wallace the first African American to handle contracts for an NFL club in 1981, and the Cards were the first to have an African-American tandem at both General Manager and head coach when Rod Graves and Dennis Green were hired for those positions in 2004. \n  \n Bringing in Welter is another step toward diversity. Her football r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is long. Welter, who holds a master\u2019s degree in sport psychology and a PhD in psychology, was the first female to play a non-kicking position in a men\u2019s pro football league when she played running backs and special teams for the Revolution in 2014. She also won two gold medals playing for Team USA in the International Federation of American Football Women\u2019s World Championship in 2010 and 2013. \n  \n \u201cShe came for an OTA and I met her, and I thought she was the type of person that could handle this in a very positive way for women and open that door,\u201d Arians said. \n  \n Arians added he had talked to the veterans on the Cardinals to tell them what he was going to do and \u201cthey were all very cool with it.\u201d \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a distraction in any way,\u201d Arians said. \n  \n The move comes at a time when women have made some small inroads into the male professional sports. Sarah Thomas has been hired this season as the NFL\u2019s first full-time female official. Becky Hammon was hired to be an assistant coach for the NBA\u2019s San Antonio Spurs last season, and as the Spurs\u2019 summer league head coach led the team to a summer championship. \n  \n Arians said it wouldn\u2019t be up to him whether putting a woman on his staff first would impact his legacy, but reiterated that he hopes it creates further opportunities for Welter and other women. \n  \n \u201cI believe very strongly in it,\u201d Arians said. ||||| TEMPE, Ariz. -- In March, Arizona Cardinals coach Bruce Arians was asked when the NFL would have a female coach. \n  \n Editor's Picks Cardinals'\u0080\u0099 Bruce Arians breaking the gender barrier? No surprise Cardinals coach Bruce Arians' hiring Jen Welter was bold, surprising and even risky. In other words, it was vintage Arians. \n  \n Weinfuss: Five things to know about Welter Five things to know about new Arizona Cardinals assistant coaching intern Jen Welter, who is believed to be the first female coach in NFL history. 1 Related \n  \n The answer was Monday. \n  \n The Cardinals hired Jen Welter as an assistant coaching intern for training camp and the preseason to work with inside linebackers. She is believed to be the first female coach of any kind in the NFL. \n  \n \"Someone asked me yesterday, 'When are we going to have female coaches?'\" Arians said. \"The minute they can prove they can make a player better, they'll be hired.\" \n  \n Welter took to Twitter after the announcement. \n  \n Welter, 37, has been making history throughout her career. In February, she became the first female coach in a men's professional football league when she was hired by the Texas Revolution of the Champions Indoor Football league to coach linebackers and special teams. The Revolution's general manager is Hall of Fame wide receiver Tim Brown. In February 2014, she became the first female to play a non-kicking position in a men's professional football league when she played running back and special teams for the Revolution. \n  \n Welter played professional football for more than 14 years as a linebacker, mostly with the Dallas Diamonds of the Women's Football Alliance. She helped lead them to four championships. \n  \n She will join linebackers coaches Bob Sanders, Larry Foote and recently hired Levon Kirkland. \n  \n A news conference is scheduled for Tuesday. \n  \n Jen Welter will work with inside linebackers during training camp and the preseason. Courtesy Texas Revolution \n  \n Speaking to azcardinals.com on Monday, Arians said: \"Coaching is nothing more than teaching. One thing I have learned from players is 'How are you going to make me better? If you can make me better, I don't care if you're the Green Hornet, I'll listen.'\" \n  \n \"I really believe she'll have a great opportunity with this internship through training camp to open some doors for her,'' Arians said. \n  \n It's the second such barrier to be broken in the NFL this year. The league announced in April that Sarah Thomas would be the first woman to be a full-time NFL official. \n  \n Vice President Joe Biden tweeted his congratulations to Welter on Tuesday: \n  \n Breaking barriers and reaching new heights. Congratulations to Jen Welter.

The former Baylor doctor received 10 years probation for raping a patient in... (Associated Press) \n  \n HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 A former Houston doctor convicted of sexually assaulting a patient while she was tethered to machines and receiving treatment for asthma won't serve any prison time and will instead serve 10 years' probation. \n  \n The punishment has surprised defense attorneys, disappointed law enforcement and raised concerns from a victims advocacy group, the Houston Chronicle reported . The victim said through a former attorney that she had no comment and wanted to put it all behind her. \n  \n Dr. Shafeeq Sheikh was sentenced Friday, a day after a Harris County jury of five women and seven men found him guilty after 14 hours of deliberations. Sheikh, 46, was not assigned to the woman's medical case at the time. He acknowledged at trial that he had sexual contact with the woman during the night shift at Ben Taub hospital in 2013 but told jurors it was consensual. \n  \n Prosecutors said the woman was weak, sore and medicate following several acute asthma episodes. The victim, who is now 32, testified that a doctor came to her bedside in the dark and began touching her breasts during a chest exam. She said she tried to summon a nurse with the call button, but witnesses testified it had been unplugged. She said the man returned twice more and sexually assaulted her. \n  \n The Associated Press generally does not identify victims of sexual assault. \n  \n Prosecutors pushed for prison time but said they respected the jury's decision. Sheikh has lost his medical license and must register as a sex offender. The jury decided the sentence. \n  \n \"When you're a doctor, I'd expect you'd get prison time,\" said attorney Casey Kiernan, who has defended sexual assault cases for nearly four decades. \"We hold doctors to a higher standard.\" \n  \n Sheikh declined comment after the sentencing. \n  \n His lawyer, Stanley Schneider, asked the jury to have mercy on a man who had a wife and children and no prior felonies. Schneider told jurors that his dreams to become a doctor \"were shattered by his conduct.\" \n  \n Sonia Corrales, chief program officer at the Houston Area Women's Center, was unfamiliar with the case but said there should be equity in sentencing violent offenders. \n  \n \"Oftentimes, perpetrators will attempt to minimize the severity of their actions by claiming it wasn't sexual assault, but was consensual sex,\" she said. \"Sexual violence is a willful choice a perpetrator makes to harm another human being and should be addressed by the criminal justice system with the same severity as any other violent crime.\" ||||| Many surprised at sentence for ex-Baylor doctor who raped a Houston hospital patient \n  \n Dr. Shafeeq Sheikh, who was convicted of raping an an acute asthma patient during a night shift when he was a resident at Baylor College of Medicine in 2013, received 10 years probation Friday, Aug. 17, 2018.

Photo: Yi-Chin Lee, Staff Photographer / Staff Photographer Photo: Yi-Chin Lee, Staff Photographer / Staff Photographer Image 1 of / 7 Caption Close Many surprised at sentence for ex-Baylor doctor who raped a Houston hospital patient 1 / 7 Back to Gallery \n  \n When a former Houston doctor was sentenced to probation Friday for raping an incapacitated patient at a county hospital, the punishment surprised defense attorneys, disappointed law enforcement, elicited concern from a rape victims advocacy group and sparked outrage on social media. \n  \n The doctor, who has been stripped of his license, admitted during the trial that he had sexual contact with the woman during the night shift at Ben Taub Hospital in 2013, but told jurors it was consensual. Although he was not assigned to her case, he slipped into her room anyway after he noticed her breast implants. \n  \n Veteran defense lawyers with no connection to the case called the outcome \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201ca big victory\u201d for the defense, explaining there was a very high likelihood a person who did not turn himself in to law enforcement and misrepresented the assault would face prison time. \n  \n \u201cWhen you\u2019re a doctor, I\u2019d expect you\u2019d get prison time,\u201d said attorney Casey Kiernan, who has defended sexual assault cases for nearly four decades. \u201cWe hold doctors to a higher standard.\u201d \n  \n The jury five women and seven men sentenced Dr. Shafeeq Sheikh, a former Baylor College of Medicine resident, to 10 years on probation for raping the patient while she was tethered to machines and receiving treatment for an acute asthma attack. \n  \n The jurors found Sheikh guilty Thursday after deliberating for 14 hours over two days. The conviction means Sheikh, 46, must be a registered for the rest of his life as a sex offender. Jurors recommended the 10-year probated sentence for the doctor and suspension of a $10,000 fine after deliberations on Friday, recommendations that visiting Senior District Judge Terry L. Flenniken was required by law to follow. \n  \n GUILTY: Verdict reached in case of ex-Baylor doctor accused of raping patient \n  \n During argument for the sentencing phase of the trial Friday, Assistant District Attorney Lauren Reeder asked jurors to keep in mind that Sheikh exploited his access to harm a vulnerable person. \n  \n \u201cHe sought her out. He chose her to prey on,\u201d Reeder said, noting that Sheikh checked the woman\u2019s chart and knew exactly what medicines she had been prescribed. \u201cYou know he\u2019s the type of man who would go in multiple times, testing the waters, seeing how far he could go and get back to his normal business after that.\u201d \n  \n The prosecutor said she hoped the jury would also consider the fact that after the assault, Sheikh went on to get another job and practiced medicine at Houston Methodist Hospital until the time police arrested him. \n  \n \u201cYou know he\u2019s the kind man of who walked around for two years before he was charged with this\u2026 knowing what he did,\u201d the prosecutor said. \n  \n Sheikh\u2019s defense lawyer, Stanley Schneider, asked the jury to have mercy on a man whose wife and children had suffered greatly from his actions and who had been punishing himself for five years for this one shameful, erratic act. He said he hoped they would sentence Sheikh, who has no prior felonies, to probation. \n  \n \u201cThe dreams of a man, the childhood dream to become a doctor, were shattered by his conduct. He destroyed his own dreams,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cWhat he has done to himself and his family is punishment. They are serving his sentence with him. His children are serving his sentence with him.\u201d \n  \n After the sentencing, the victim said through a former attorney that she had no comment on the punishment and wanted to put it all behind her and move on. \n  \n Sheikh, who has been free on bond, also declined comment. After the judge adjourned, Sheikh sat with some family members outside the courthouse having lunch at a picnic table. \n  \n Prosecutors respect the process that rendered the result, said Dane Schiller, a spokesman for District Attorney Kim Ogg. \n  \n \u201cAfter being presented all the evidence, the jury convicted this man of rape and decided that he should be sentenced to 10 years of probation,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cThe jury voted on behalf of the community to determine his sentence, and although prosecutors sought prison time, we respect this process, and the jury\u2019s decision, which carries with it a lifetime of registering as a sex offender.\u201d \n  \n It took investigators two years to charge Sheikh in the 2013 assault. He was only then, in 2015, that the Texas Medical Board revoked his license, finding that he posed \u201ca continuing threat to public welfare.\u201d \n  \n Stefanie Asin, a representative of Houston Methodist Hospital, said Sheikh worked briefly for the hospital system following his time at Baylor, \u201cbut (he) was immediately suspended and then terminated when we learned of the allegations and the suspension of his license.\u201d \n  \n She noted that at the time Sheikh worked for Methodist none of the allegations had surfaced, adding, \u201cThere were no reports of misconduct or any incidents involving this doctor while he was at Houston Methodist.\u201d \n  \n Both the victim, who is now 32, and the former doctor took the stand during the eight-day trial, providing contradictory accounts of what happened the night of Nov. 2, 2013. The victim said a doctor came to her bedside in the dark and began touching her breasts during a chest exam. She said she was weak, sore and confused, and tried to summon a nurse with the call button. The man returned two more times, and raped her without using a condom. \n  \n TRIAL: Former Ben Taub doctor accused of raping patient testifies sex was consensual \n  \n Sheikh said the patient took his hand and placed it on her breasts. He was intrigued by her breast implants and returned to her room again. At this point, he testified, she began touching his genitals and demonstrated with her body language that she wanted to have sex with him. He said he knew it was a breach of his marriage vows and the Hippocratic oath, but he succumbed to his impulse. He told jurors he understood that it was consensual sex. \n  \n The Houston Chronicle does not identify victims of sexual assault. \n  \n The woman, who was identified previously in a series of Houston Chronicle columns by Lisa Falkenberg as Laura, reported an assault by an unknown doctor the same day. Sheikh told jurors he checked her chart several times that day after he heard she had told officials it was a rape. He said he told his wife about his infidelity right away but he didn\u2019t come forward to hospital officials because he panicked about the consequences. \n  \n BACKGROUND: Patient says she became doctor's prey at Ben Taub \n  \n Police eventually got a list of every man on the premises that night and began collecting cheek swabs of willing subjects. Sheikh only provided one when he was subpoenaed, according to a law enforcement source. DNA evidence from the woman\u2019s rape kit implicated Sheikh as a likely suspect. Sheikh had been working a night shift as an internal medicine resident. He was seen on surveillance video on the woman's floor and his badge was used to swipe onto her floor that night at least 12 times. \n  \n One factor that could have impacted what some saw as a lenient sentence was the testimony from his wife, brother and family friends, who spoke about his vital role as the father of four children. \n  \n Attorney Paul Schiffer, a former prosecutor who has devoted more than four decades to defending people charged with sex offenses, said he thought Sheikh was fortunate. \n  \n \u201cDefendants who take the stand and deny they\u2019re guilty statistically are in a worse position to get probation,\u201d Schiffer said. \u201cBut various factors, including their history while on bond and the impact incarceration could have on their own children can be a significant factor.\u201d \n  \n He and Kiernan, who also defends people accused of rape, said it also may have been the case that jurors had residual doubt about his culpability. \n  \n Kiernan suggested there was another important factor jurors may have mulled over. \n  \n \u201cThe real question is whether the best interest of the defendant and society are served by sentencing him to the penitentiary,\u201d he said. \n  \n Sonia Corrales, chief program officer at the Houston Area Women\u2019s Center, was unfamiliar with the case but said there should be equity in sentencing violent offenders. \n  \n \u201cOftentimes, perpetrators will attempt to minimize the severity of their actions by claiming it wasn\u2019t sexual assault, but was consensual sex,\u201d she said. \u201cSexual violence is a willful choice a perpetrator makes to harm another human being and should be addressed by the criminal justice system with the same severity as any other violent crime.\u201d \n  \n gabrielle.banks@chron.com \n  \n twitter.com/gabmobanks |||||"}, {"instruction": "You will be given a context, a subject and a relation.

The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said preliminary data show that the ACOs produced $380 million in savings vis-a-vis traditional Medicare in 2012 by giving doctors and other healthcare providers the incentive to focus on improved outcomes for patients instead of fees from tests and services. Medicare, the $575 billion government healthcare system for 51 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, faces growing financial pressures as a result of America\u2019s aging population. A mainstay, the trust fund that pays for hospitalization, is expected to be exhausted in 2026. Deficit hawks view Medicare as a future driver of the federal debt and have called for major systemic reforms. But the Obama administration has pursued gradual changes including the reform of care delivery systems. So-called fee-for-service medicine is widely viewed as a cause of rising healthcare costs, because it calls for paying healthcare providers for tests and services that are sometimes unnecessary. Obamacare seeks to tackle costs by exploring ACOs and other new healthcare business models intended to find savings that do not jeopardize care. A main goal is to generate savings large enough to be shared between Medicare and providers. But some experts are skeptical, saying significant cost reductions could be hard to maintain over time. But CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, runs two different ACO programs. In its largest, 54 of 114 ACO networks achieved lower than expected expenditures. But only 29 saw savings big enough to share with providers. All told, the program produced $128 million in net savings for Medicare\u2019s trust funds. \u201cOverall, the ACO program\u2019s a net saver to the Medicare program,\u201d CMS principal deputy administrator Jon Blum told reporters in a conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s giving us great confidence that this is the right course for the Medicare program and we are confident that it will continue to show quality improvement and cost savings.\u201d  Officials said the ACOs also achieved a wide range of quality goals. But CMS released no quality statistics. Thursday\u2019s government release drew some cautious optimism from the healthcare industry. \u201cToday\u2019s report reflects important steps. More work is needed to modernize our antiquated Medicare payment system and base payment on evidence-based quality measures and proven patient outcomes,\u201d said Dr. John Noseworthy, chief executive of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which is not part of the government\u2019s program. \u201cAs results of the team-based care models are analyzed, those most effective in driving down health care costs without compromising safety and quality should become part of the healthcare system,\u201d he said.

The company is facing some 11,700 lawsuits over the safety of talc in its products. Leavitt\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Satterley, accused J&J in his opening statement of knowingly selling a dangerous product, according to an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. \u201cThe evidence will show that J&J knew about the asbestos risk and they continued to sell the product, giving consumers no opportunity to protect themselves,\u201d he said. A lawyer for co-defendant Imerys Talc America, a unit of French Imerys SA (IMTP.PA), told the jury the evidence would show there is no asbestos in its talc and that Leavitt\u2019s disease was not caused by its product. A lawyer for J&J will make his opening remarks on Tuesday. \u201cOur talc is safe and does not contain asbestos. For decades, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder has repeatedly been tested and been found not to contain asbestos,\u201d the company said in response to a request for comment on Monday. J&J and Imerys have argued in court that decades of studies have shown their products to be safe and asbestos-free. Leavitt\u2019s is the first talc case to go to trial since Reuters on Dec. 14 published a special report detailing internal J&J documents showing talc in the company\u2019s raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s. The report prompted a stock selloff on fears of J&J\u2019s liability. Shares on Monday closed at $127.01, 14 percent below their Dec. 13 value. While earlier talc lawsuits alleged talc itself causes ovarian cancer, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have more recently focused on arguing that asbestos contamination in talc caused mesothelioma, a form of cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Leavitt\u2019s case is being tried by the same team of lawyers, including Satterley, who in April 2018 won a $117 million award by a New Jersey jury for a man who blamed his mesothelioma on J&J\u2019s cosmetic talc. That verdict is under appeal. In 11 cases so far alleging asbestos contamination in talc, three resulted in wins for plaintiffs, awarding damages as high as $4.69 billion in a July 2018 multi-plaintiff ovarian cancer verdict. J&J won three other cases and another five ended in hung juries. J&J has appealed all of the plaintiff verdicts, and the company said it is confident the verdicts would be overturned on appeal. Leavitt was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017. She was born in the Philippines and claims she was exposed to J&J cosmetic talc that originated from South Korea mines during the first two years of her life before her parents moved back to the United States in 1968, Satterley said on Monday. He said testing of Asian talc samples from the 1960s and 1970s by his own expert would show Korean-mined talc tested positive for asbestos fibers, as has talc from U.S. sources. J&J in court filings in the Leavitt case said that fibers found in the Korean talc or any of its other cosmetic talc could not be classified as asbestos and referred to them as non-asbestos forms that its experts say are harmless. Geologically, some asbestos can occur as \u201cnon-asbestiform\u201d rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

The image provided no citations to substantiate the information it presented, and the notion that opossums were a possible tool in the epidemiological battle against Lyme disease seemed implausible to some. As it turned out, there is at least some truth to the opossum-as-tick-slayer rumors. On 18 April 2014, the Cary Institute of\u00a0Ecosystem Studies and NewsTimes published an article that focused on the role of opossums in the spread of Lyme disease with respect to their role in the ecosystem: [N]ow ecologists have learned something else about opossums. They\u2019re a sort of magnet when it comes to riding the world of black-legged ticks, which spread Lyme disease. \u201cDon\u2019t hit opossums if they\u2019ve playing dead in the road,\u201d said Richard Ostfeld, of the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. Ostfeld is forest ecologist and an expert on the environmental elements of infectious diseases like Lyme disease. Several years ago, scientists \u2026\u00a0tested six species \u2014 white-footed mice, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums and veerys and catbirds \u2014 by capturing and caging them, and then exposing each test subject to 100 ticks\u00a0\u2026\u00a0[O]f the six, the opossums were remarkably good at getting rid of the ticks \u2014 much more so that any of the others. [A]mong other opossum traits, there is this: They groom themselves fastidiously, like cats. If they find a tick, they lick it off and swallow it\u00a0\u2026\u00a0Extrapolating from their findings, Ostfeld said, the team estimated that in one season, an opossum can kill about 5,000 ticks \u2026 Some ticks end up getting their blood meal from the possum. But more than 90 percent of them ended up being groomed away and swallowed. \u201cThey\u2019re net destroyers of ticks,\u201d Ostfeld said. Ostfeld had previously discouraged disruption of opossum populations for this reason. In July 2012, he said\u00a0in a podcast: Because many ticks try to feed on opossums and few of them survive the experience. Opossums are extraordinarily good groomers it turns out \u2014 we never would have thought that ahead of time \u2014 but they kill the vast majority \u2014 more than 95% percent of the ticks that try to feed on them. So these opossums are walking around the forest floor, hoovering up ticks right and left, killing over 90% of these things, and so they are really protecting our health. Ostfeld was also named as one author of a September\u00a02009 study in\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society which examined animal kingdom hosts \u201cas\u00a0ecological traps for the vector of Lyme disease\u201d and asserted that: By subjecting field-caught hosts to parasitism by larval blacklegged ticks, we found that some host species (e.g. opossums, squirrels) that are abundantly parasitized in nature kill 83\u201396% of the ticks that attempt to attach and feed, while other species are more permissive of tick feeding. [T]he vast majority (96.5%) of larval ticks that encounter an opossum and attempt to feed are apparently consumed. Working backwards, [we calculate that] during any given week in the larval activity peak, each opossum must host more than 5500 larval ticks to produce 199 that successfully feed. By this logic, during the larval peak, each mouse encounters approximately 50 larval ticks per week, almost half of which feed to repletion and become nymphs. As far as \u201camazing facts\u201d images go, the opossum/Lyme disease one was very well researched, with numbers that matched up with what ecologists have learned about opossums, deer ticks, and the spread of Lyme disease in recent years (although those studies surmised opossums kill approximately 5,000 ticks per season, not per week). Claim: Opossums kill thousands of ticks each week, inhibiting the spread of Lyme Disease to humans."}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

While Underwood is no fan of President Donald Trump, she said her No. 1 concern \u2014 and the top concern of the voters she hopes to will send her to Washington \u2014 is access to health care.

He has a higher approval rating than my congressman does, so we talk about our congressman,\u201d said Underwood, who\u2019s hoping to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Randy Hultgren in a district that narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Other Democrats aiming to flip House seats say they\u2019re also trying to zero in on policy more than the president. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has its hopes pinned on 50-plus candidates looking to upend enough seats \u2014 23 \u2014 to wrest control of the chamber from the GOP for the first time in eight years. Republicans have their own plan to retain control, but Democrats are banking they have more than just both momentum and history on their side. U.S. Rep. Denny Heck is helping lead the effort to flip the House. The Washington Democrat said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee can assist candidates with a range of tasks \u2014 from tapping into a national donor base to aiding with the basic mechanics of building a campaign. But he warned that trash-talking Trump will get a candidate only so far. \u201cWhat candidates ought to be doing is talking about that crowded freeway that they need to get additional funds to widen or additional funds to provide mass transit for, or that lake that is becoming polluted and they need the EPA to step up,\u201d Heck said.

Mucarsel-Powell, who came from Ecuador as an immigrant with her mother, said Florida\u2019s 26th Congressional District \u2014 the state\u2019s southernmost district \u2014 is one of the most vulnerable for Republicans in the country. She pointed to a 16-point win by Hillary Clinton there in 2016. The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. While Mucarsel-Powell doesn\u2019t shy away from talking about Trump, she says she\u2019s more focused on the struggles of local residents. \u201cThey don\u2019t have access to health care. They don\u2019t have good quality education,\u201d she said, adding that tens of thousands depend on the Obama 2010 health care law that Republicans have worked to undo. Talk of a Democratic blue wave is overblown, according to Matt Gorman, communication director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He said the committee \u2014 which has its own \u201cYoung Guns\u201d program \u2014 is raising impressive sums and has battle-tested incumbents who know they\u2019re going to be targets. Gorman said the NRCC is also urging candidates to run on local issues and not focus on the latest headlines on cable new or Twitter. He said polling shows the party is in better shape than many assume. \u201cThis is going to be a fight and certainly we\u2019re going to work like we\u2019re 10 points down as we do every day, but for the bedwetters out there who are claiming that all hope is loss I would encourage them to actually look at the data,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s simple math.\u201d Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark, who is also heading up the DCCC\u2019s \u201cRed to Blue\u201d initiative, said many candidates she\u2019s been working with are more eager to dig into what\u2019s on the minds of voters than taking swipes at Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re not concerned with talking about Donald Trump as much as they are about talking about how people in their communities want their children to have job opportunities in the communities that they grew up in,\u201d Clark said. While defeating Trump may galvanize the Democratic faithful, the party is still fumbling for a wider unifying message, according to Tobe Berkovitz, a Boston University professor and former political media consultant. And Democrats may have trouble finding issues, local or not, for voters to latch onto in November. \u201cThe problem is that unemployment is low, economic confidence is relatively high, so to tell people you\u2019ve never had it so bad when compared to eight years ago they\u2019ve got it pretty good, that\u2019s sort of also a tough road to hoe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats may have history on the side.

At the show, such companies were scattered throughout the health and wellness section, near startups pitching fitness trackers and infrared saunas. Lora DiCarlo, a startup that pushed for changes after organizers revoked its award, showed off its Os\u00e9 robotic \u201cpersonal massager.\u201d It\u2019s one of a dozen companies at the show focused on vibrators, lube dispensers and other sex tech products. Founders of these startups say their products are about empowerment and wellness for women, something they say has often been overlooked in tech. The historically male-dominated tech trade show has received criticism in past years for having an all-male lineup of speakers and for previously allowing scantily clad \u201cbooth babes,\u201d fostering a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d reputation. Besides allowing sex tech, CES organizers brought in an official \u201cequality partner,\u201d The Female Quotient, to help ensure gender diversity. The Female Quotient, which trains companies in equality practices, will hold a conference for women during the four-day show, which opened Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a process,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Technology Association, which puts on CES. It\u2019s been a longer process for many sex tech companies to convince investors that they are part of a growing trend that has enough customers. Much of the push has come from the startups\u2019 female founders and from younger consumers who talk more openly about sexuality. As with other technologies, some exhibitors including Lora DiCarlo had prominent booths at CES, while others such as the wearable vibrator company Crave were tucked away. Crave\u2019s exhibit included a camper with a \u201cBuild-a-Vibe-Workshop,\u201d where attendees could get an engraved vibrator to wear around their neck. Sex tech has existed in some form for decades. But the gates really began to open in 2016, said Andrea Barrica, founder of sex education site O.school. That year, several other \u201cfem tech\u201d companies made progress in areas such as menstruation and menopause. Those paved the way for sex tech to grow and get investors interested. \u201cLarger institutions are starting to take note, all the way from VC firms to large Fortune 100 companies,\u201d said Barrica, who recently published the book \u201cSextech Revolution: The Future of Sexual Wellness.\u201d Large institutions like CES had no choice but to look at sex tech, she said. The journey hasn\u2019t been easy. Sex tech founders, many of them women, recount being turned down by dozens of investors. They faced decency arguments and entrenched corporate standards that equated them with porn. But investors are becoming more receptive, said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive turned sex tech entrepreneur and founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely because of our refusal to allow the business world to put us down,\u201d she said. Founders insist that their devices \u2014 ranging from vibrators to lube dispensers to accessories \u2014 have effects outside the bedroom. \u201cSexual health and wellness is health and wellness,\u201d said Lora DiCarlo, CEO and founder of the company of the same name. \u201cIt does way more than just pleasure. It\u2019s immediately connected to stress relief, to better sleep, to empowerment and confidence.\u201d DiCarlo\u2019s $290 Os\u00e9 device has gotten $3 million worth of advance sales, bolstered in part by the attention it received after CES organizers overturned a decision by an independent panel of judges to give the vibrator a prestigious Innovation Honoree Award in the robotics and drone category. The organizers, CTA, told the company it reserved the right to rescind awards for devices deemed \u201cimmoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA\u2019s image.\u201d DiCarlo and other female founders pushed back for banning them but allowing humanoid sex robots meant to serve men the previous year. Following criticism, CES organizers ultimately  reinstated the award and apologized. A few months later, the show announced policy changes such as a dress code to prevent skimpy outfits and new \u201cInnovation for All\u201d sessions with senior diversity officials. Os\u00e9 began shipping to customers this month. DiCarlo said the company is planning to introduce new devices, including less expensive options. Sex tech companies still face major barriers to growth. Polly Rodriguez, CEO of sexual wellness company Unbound, said the company is profitable and customers are more open about buying products than they once were. But she said she still faces roadblocks advertising on social media, and many traditional investors snub the company. \u201cThings are better, but there\u2019s just still this genuine fear of female sexuality more broadly within the institutional side of technology,\u201d she said. And while Gallop offered to speak at CES, conference organizers declined, saying sex tech was not a part of its conference programming. ___ AP Business Writer Joseph Pisani contributed to this report. ___ AP\u2019s CES coverage: https://apnews.com/Consumerelectronics Claim: Sex tech from women-led startups pops up at CES gadget show."}, {"instruction": "Generate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

We know some members may find this inconvenient or objectionable, but under the circumstances we believe the added safety is worth any inconvenience.

Although some may disagree with this policy or question its effectiveness, we\u2019re choosing to err on the side of safety in our shopping environments. Costco has continued to operate during this crisis as an essential business in all of our communities, and our employees are on the front lines. As part of a community, we believe this simple act of safety and courtesy is one that Costco members and employees can undertake together.However, the requirement does not extend to children under the age of 2 or to anyone who cannot wear a mask or face covering for medical reasons.Several states and retail chains have shifted safety policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with some opting to walk back laws banning the use of non-reusable shopping bags.Comments Claim: CostCo stores will require shoppers to wear masks beginning on May 4, 2020."}, {"instruction": "Given a paragraph about cooking, and a set of conversational question answers about the paragraph, generate a relevant question to the topic of the paragraph.

Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%.

Presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton greets people before speaking in Washington on September 17. \"I've reached the conclusion that the best way to support our troops is begin bringing them home,\" the New York senator and former first lady told CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.\" \"I don't believe we should continue to vote for funding that has an open-ended commitment, that has no pressure on the Iraqi government to make the tough political decisions they have to make, or which really gives any urgency to the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts.\" Clinton's declaration comes as the Senate debates the Defense Department's 2008 spending authorization bill. It follows her vote against a $120 billion war-spending bill in May, when Congress dropped a call for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 2008 after President Bush vetoed a bill containing that provision. \"The president has no intention of changing his policy in Iraq,\" she said. \"He's now talking about leaving it to his successor.\" Meanwhile, the Senate's Republican minority routinely filibusters Democratic proposals to wind down the war, which is costing the Treasury about $10 billion a month and has claimed the lives of nearly 3,800 American troops. May's spending bill made continued U.S. support contingent on a set of benchmarks for Iraq's government. But the Iraqis met only 11 of the 18 benchmarks, according to the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. \"Even those who are implementing this policy of the president's cannot tell us it will make America more safe, nor that it will lead to the kind of political decision-making that we have to expect from the Iraqis themselves,\" Clinton said. Nearly two-thirds of the American public now opposes the war, according to a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted in early September. Clinton said, if elected president, she would end the conflict \"as quickly and responsibly as I can,\" but said some U.S. forces would likely remain as trainers, to protect Americans and to battle Islamic militants loyal to al Qaeda. The two-term senator, who leads her Democratic presidential rivals by a double-digit margin in national polls, made the rounds of all five Washington talk shows Sunday. Last week, Clinton supported two amendments that would have forced the Pentagon to begin a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. But she said Sunday that even if Democrats muster enough Republican support to break a filibuster -- something they have been unable to do -- Democrats would still be unlikely to get the two-thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto. \"The answer for this is, let's elect more Democrats in 2008,\" she said. \"That will help solve the problem.\" E-mail to a friend ."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are bracing for a rough election night next Tuesday, and top leaders are making a major push for rank and file members to open their wallets to help save those vulnerable Democrats who are in danger of losing their seats. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep Steve Israel, D-New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, held a conference call Tuesday afternoon with House Democrats and told them it was time to pony up -- and gave them a Friday deadline. According to a source on the call, a dozen House members and two Democratic candidates pledged almost $500,000 during the session. Several Democratic sources told CNN that members are expecting Republicans to pick up some seats, but they still believe that many House Democrats in competitive districts are positioned to survive if they get support. The DCCC has invested heavily in field operations with 950 staff in 40 districts. But the surge of outside money from GOP groups on new television and radio spots, combined with contributions from several wealthy GOP candidates, has Democrats concerned. In a memo circulated to House Democrats, the DCCC chairman argued that the uptick in GOP spending by outside groups was something the committee was prepared to counter. Israel wrote that despite the effort by Republicans and their allies, \"not a single Democratic incumbent is out of contention. This is a stark contrast from 2010, where many incumbents were already down and out despite our best efforts.\" But Israel also said, \"This climate is incredibly challenging and only getting harder.\" So, with seven days left before the midterms, the leaders stepped up the pressure on members to give now. The DCCC has consistently out-raised its GOP counterpart over the course of the 2014 election cycle. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, House Democrats have raised over $172 million for the midterms, while House Republicans have raised about $131 million. For Democrats, much of the money has been brought in by top leaders like Pelosi, Israel and Rep Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat. The purpose of the call on Tuesday was to make it clear that they expect others, especially those who were given plum committee posts by their leaders, to lend a hand. There are always members in both parties who sit on money in their campaign accounts at the end of an election cycle. Some of these members might be considering a bid for the Senate or governor, or may be reluctant to share the cash with their colleagues. But the ones who spent hours hosting fundraisers and trekking over to the Democratic headquarters to dial donors for dollars are frustrated with colleagues who don't reach their targets and don't seem to suffer major repercussions. According to a DCCC dues sheet obtained by CNN, about 90% of House Democrats have contributed to the campaign committee, but 77 -- less than half of the House Democratic caucus -- have paid the full amount of dues for the 2014 midterms. Leaders were expected to raise between $450,000 and $800,000 for this cycle, and data from the DCCC shows 37 House Democrats exceeded their goals. Democrats on key committees overseeing banks, telecommunications companies, and other industries who donate to campaigns are also expected to raise significant money -- between $200,000 and $500,000 per election cycle, depending on their committee and seniority. But the 2013-2014 dues sheet shows many of those committee leaders fell short on their fundraising goals. For example, Michigan Rep Sander Levin, who is the top Democrat on the tax writing committee, gave $525,000 -- more than his assigned $500,000. But California Democratic Rep Henry Waxman, who is the most senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel, and a close ally of Pelosi's, has sent in $10,000 of his $500,000 in dues. Waxman's office did not respond to an inquiry from CNN. Internal tallies of members' campaign contributions are regularly shared among House Democrats. Making sure fellow Democrats see the spreadsheets that show who is paying up and who isn't is a tool leaders hope will shame those who haven't given significant amounts yet to write checks. But it's also a list leaders keep in mind when they decide who gets to keep slots on powerful committees in the next Congress."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "(CNN) -- The former Penn State assistant football coach currently awaiting trial on child sex assault charges can visit with some of his grandchildren, a judge ruled Monday. The decision by Judge John Cleland eases some conditions of Jerry Sandusky's house arrest, which had forbidden contact with his 11 grandchildren. Joe Amendola, Sandusky's attorney, said the former assistant coach and his family are happy about the ruling. \"Jerry, Dottie, and their entire family are very relieved by and pleased with the court's decision,\" Amendola said in a written statement. Sandusky will be allowed to visit with eight of his grandchildren under parental supervision, Cleland ruled. But another judge in a custody case involving the other three grandchildren should decide whether Sandusky can visit with them, Cleland ruled. The mother of those children has strongly objected to them having contact with Sandusky. State Attorney General Linda Kelly had blasted Sandusky's request to see his grandchildren, saying in a motion earlier this month that Sandusky was fortunate to be granted house arrest when \"he is alleged to have committed 52 sexual offenses.\" Kelly also argued that Sandusky should be required to stay indoors during his house arrest because of fears among neighbors and teachers at a nearby elementary school. Cleland denied that request Monday, ruling that prosecutors did not present any evidence showing that Sandusky had tried to contact children at the school. The state \"failed to present any evidence whatsoever that (Sandusky) presents a clearly defined threat to any student at the adjoining elementary school simply by being on his deck,\" Monday's the ruling says. Cleland also ruled Monday that Sandusky would be allowed to have visits from adult friends and to leave his home for meetings with attorneys and private investigators aiding in his defense, provided that a probation coordinator approves. \"Jerry is also happy he can now have visitation with long-time friends with the prior approval of the Probation Department and will be able to continue to use the deck to his home to exercise, care for and supervise his dog, Bo, when Bo is in the yard,\" Amendola said in his statement issued after Monday's ruling. Sandusky has been under house arrest since December, when he was charged with sexually abusing young boys over a 15-year period. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Cleland has said he is aiming for a May 14 trial for Sandusky. On Monday, the judge denied a prosecution request that jurors be selected from outside the county where the former coach is being prosecuted. The allegations against Sandusky led to the firing of Penn State's heralded head football coach Joe Paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer. Tim Curley, Penn State's former athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged 2002 sexual assault of a child. Both of them have pleaded not guilty. On Monday an attorney requested that the perjury charge against Curley be dropped, arguing that Paterno's death means prosecutors no longer have a required second witness to support the charge. CNN's Jason Carroll and Mark Norman contributed to this report."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage. Even though I was a lawyer in the litigation and in the courthouse both days, I can't predict which way the court will come down. But the outcomes range from nothing at all to fundamentally restructuring the foundational unit of western civilization. Hollingsworth v. Perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. United States v. Windsor asks whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman, is unconstitutional. DOMA passed in 1996 with 78% of the U.S. House and 85% of the Senate and was signed by President Bill Clinton. The whole nation is focused on the litigation. Ironically, it's possible that neither case will be decided on the merits. In Hollingsworth, California's governor and attorney general abdicated their duties by refusing to defend their state constitution. So pursuant to California law, the sponsors of Prop 8 \u2014 officially registered with the state \u2014 stepped in to defend the law, represented by Charles Cooper at Cooper Kirk and the Alliance Defending Freedom. In Windsor, the defendant was the federal government. But President Barack Obama declared that he believes DOMA is unconstitutional and ordered his Justice Department not to defend it. So per its rules, the U.S. House voted to authorize Paul Clement  \u2014 probably the greatest Supreme Court lawyer practicing today \u2014 to defend DOMA. Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts. One requirement is that there must be adversity between the parties. Since the defendants in both cases refused to defend their own laws, the court will consider whether the Constitution allows these third-party legal teams to become a proper party to the lawsuits. There's a second issue in Windsor. Edith Windsor entered into a gay marriage in Canada in 2007 and lived in New York. When her partner died in 2009, Windsor sued to contest the federal estate tax she paid, claiming a spousal exemption. But New York did not create gay marriage until 2011, so Windsor was not harmed by DOMA not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage, since if the IRS used state definitions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman. Thus it's possible she lacks standing to sue over the issue. It also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages, which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide. The swing vote regarding the Article III issues in both cases is probably Chief Justice John Roberts. He openly expressed skepticism in Hollingsworth and led the Court in an hour-long debate in Windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction. Assuming the court does decide the merits, the implications are historic. Windsor would alter America's system of federalism. Only the states determine who can get married. But the federal government is free to decide whom to confer federal benefits on \u2014 largely economic entitlements and federal issues such as immigration. Federalism is a two-way street. But if DOMA Section 3 is invalidated, the states will be able to dictate whom the recipients of federal benefits are. If Windsor is historic, Hollingsworth is earth-shattering. If the Supreme Court declares a constitutional right to marriage other than one-man, one-woman, then all traditional marriage laws in all 50 states will be invalid, and there will be a serious debate (already in a lower federal court) of whether polygamists also have a constitutional right to national recognition. On the merits, the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage, though arguments did not go as well for DOMA. Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely the swing vote in both. As Justice Samuel Alito said this week, the Internet and cell phones have been around on this planet longer than gay marriage. It is an energetic debate in all 50 states, and this summer we will learn whether the Supreme Court will shut down this debate by making it a constitutional issue on which the American people are not allowed to vote."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "(CNN) -- On Monday, news broke that about 200 girls had been kidnapped from their school in Chibok, in the northeastern state of Borno -- a region at the center of Nigeria's five-year terrorist insurgency. The very next day, the Nigerian military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued. This turned out to be untrue. The school's principal and the girls' parents complained that the girls were still missing. In August last year, a military spokesman announced the death of Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, at the hands of the military. But like the news of the release of the schoolgirls, it proved to be fiction. 'Misleading sources' Incidents like this have come to shape the way the military is perceived in the wildly unpredictable battle against Boko Haram. Posts on the military's social media accounts regularly boast of \"smoking out\" or ambushing terrorists or recovering weapons -- often written in way that brings to mind Iraq's infamous former information minister under Saddam Hussein, dubbed \"Comical Ali,\" who claimed coalition forces were in retreat even as American tanks rolled almost unchallenged across the country in 2003. Like him they've also ended up pinning the blame for inaccurate reporting on \"misleading\" sources. Even when there is truth to its narratives -- and there have been major successes, including a crackdown that started in early 2013 that killed several top Boko Harem commanders and driven others across the border into Chad, Niger and Cameroon -- the triumphalism seems odd when juxtaposed with the harsh reality of events like the Chibok abduction, or the one at another government school in neighboring Yobe State in February, in which more than fifty schoolboys were murdered in their dormitories, with nary a soldier in sight until several hours later. Perhaps the military resorts to this impulsively buoyant tone because it believes it cannot afford to sound anything otherwise. Or perhaps it's simply because it can get away with it -- because the Nigerian authorities have a long and remarkable history of getting away with anything they say. That tenuous relationship with fact makes it relatively easy for senior government officials to publicly dispute government finances to the tune of billions of dollars; and for an assortment of newspaper headlines to display wildly differing casualty figures the morning after a bombing incident. Death 'cheap and plentiful' And then there's the scale of Nigeria's tragedies. For a country that is not at war, death is cheap and plentiful. So cheap and so sweeping in its audacity that Nigerians readily make jokes about it. That might help explain the trademark blunted edge of Nigerian outrage. If it happens often enough, the mind is soon inured, and eagerly accepting of the sense of resignation that might offer the best protection against the emotional impact of the next cycle of negative breaking news. All of the above combine to create the context in which the Nigerian military -- wielding political power for 29 of Nigeria's first 39 years after independence -- has learned to operate. Not since the civil war, almost 50 years ago, has it been tested this much. The closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which it played a prominent role at the head of the West African ECOMOG Force, intended more as a \"peacekeeping\" unit than a combat force. Indeed what we are seeing may be evidence of its struggle to adapt to new rules of engagement, fighting an enemy driven by convictions much deeper than those displayed by the pro-democracy activists and diamond-obsessed rebels it contended with in the 1990s; possessing access to sophisticated weapons, and operating in terrain far better suited to insurgents than conventional armies. Abuse claims . The increasing militarization of the troubled zones has since spurred accusations of human rights abuses, from local and international observers. An International Crisis Group report from April 2014 has called for an end to the use of \"heavy-handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless, jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism.\" Communication strategies also require overhaul. In the age of social media, the military needs to realize that propaganda is now a lot more likely to be found out and discredited. News reports suggest that the military, long hampered by aging hardware, is now acquiring new weapons and equipment. That's heartwarming. In a country where institutional graft is the rule and not the exception, it is crucial to ensure that the military budgets are spent to boost the military's capability, and troops' morale -- and not pocketed by bigwigs. International cooperation also needs to be stepped up; and it does seem that the government is now more willing than ever to work with Europe and America. Nigerians have long been wary of allowing the American military the sort of foothold it has in countries like Yemen and Pakistan, but there's certainly room for more intense cooperation that does not involve abdicating total control. Finally the military will need to prepare to adapt itself to the reality of the government's planned shift to a \"soft\" counter-terrorism strategy, embodied in a document unveiled by National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, a retired Army Colonel, in March. Amid the backlash it has faced recently, the beleaguered military can count on the support of a growing number of Nigerians, who think that it is being under appreciated for the work it is doing.

At most a few hundred -- and as few as a couple dozen -- of the animals are thought to exist. Because of that rarity and its elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the \"Asian unicorn.\" That moniker comes despite the fact it has two closely spaced parallel horns. \"These are the most important wild animal photographs taken in Asia, and perhaps the world, in at least the past decade,\" said William Robichaud, coordinator of the Saola Working Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission, in a World Wildlife Fund press release. Scientists discover new species in Australian rainforest . \"This is an historic moment in Vietnam's efforts to protect our extraordinary biodiversity,\" Dang Dinh Nguyen, deputy head of the country's Quang Nam Forest Protection Department, said in the release. The picture of the animal was taken in September in a reserve in the Central Annamite Mountains and announced by the WWF on Tuesday. 441 species discovered in Amazon since 2010 . Van Ngoc Thinh, WWF-Vietnam's country director, called the picture \"a breath-taking discovery.\" \"When our team first looked at the photos we couldn't believe our eyes. Saola are the holy grail for Southeast Asian conservationists,\" Van said in a press release. The saola, which is a relative of cattle but looks like an antelope, was first discovered in 1992 in forests along the Vietnam-Laos border. A WWF survey team found a skull of the animal in a hunter's home. In Vietnam, a saola was last seen in the wild in 1998. In Laos, a remote camera snapped a picture of one in the wild in 1999. And in 2010, Laotian villagers captured a saola that died before word got to researchers. Olinguito: The newest rare mammal species . There are no saola in captivity. Environmentalists said Wednesday the pictures show that efforts to save the saola are working. \"Saola are caught in wire snares set by hunters to catch other animals, such as deer and civets, which are largely destined for the lucrative illegal wildlife trade,\" Van said in the WWF release. \"Since 2011, forest guard patrols ... have removed more than 30,000 snares from this critical saola habitat and destroyed more than 600 illegal hunters' camps.\" New legless lizards found in California .

More than 40 percent of the average household food budget is spent on eating out, says Jeff Yeager. The author of \"The Ultimate Cheapskate's Road Map to True Riches\" has some ideas for saving $20,000 to $30,000 a year. The savings don't necessarily require sacrifices, he says, but rather choices that can lead to greater happiness. Yeager talked with Heidi Collins on Tuesday on \"CNN Newsroom.\" A transcript of their conversation follows. Heidi Collins: How did you become a cheapskate, if you will? Jeff Yeager: Well, you know, I'm about 50 years old. I grew up in the Midwest, and back then, spending money was really a last resort. We led sort of a simpler life, and I think, in a lot of ways, happier, Heidi. And that's really what I write about is, maybe there's a silver lining to this economic downturn. Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more. Collins: All right. As a fellow Midwesterner, I share your cheapskate thoughts already. Yeager: You are a sister of the cheaphood. I knew it, Heidi. Collins: Well, hey. I do wonder, though, as you've gone through this process, if you will, if you become the ultimate cheapskate, are you noticing now a lot more people kind of joining your club? Yeager: You know, they are. And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice. I talk about a life of choices and how, in many instances, less can be more.  Watch Jeff Yeager explain his savings suggestions \u00bb . You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less. I'm not saying that's unimportant. But maybe we're missing the real point. The secret to the time is being content with less. Collins: OK. Wow. I like the way you talk. All right, so let's get to these five things, because that's what everybody really wants to hear about. Specifically, what they can do. And again, this is in order to save 20,000 to $30,000 a year. Really? Yeager: If these things apply to your family. Collins: OK. Yeager: And they are -- let me say in advance -- these are some fairly radical changes. But, again, it's probably not about sacrifice. It's about changing your life and maybe in the end being happier. Collins: OK. Well, very good. First thing you say, give up your cell phone. Yeager: Give up the cellulite life. I will use myself as a poster child. You know, I have a fairly successful career, a very happy life. I've never owned a cell phone, and nothing awful has ever happened. Collins: Now, wait a minute. I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business. Yeager: We can debate all that, but 10 or 15 years ago, none of us had it, and nothing awful happened. It seemed to me we were really quite happy. Average cell phone plan costs about $100 a month. There's an interesting article in the recent Christian Science Monitor that shows the actual cost of using a cell phone could be more than $3 a minute by time you factor in unused minutes and so on. Collins: Wow. All right. You say you might not need that second car and certainly not the third? Yeager: Americans own about 2\u00bd cars per family. Can you give up one? The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on. So, you could easily be talking about $5,000 to $10,000 savings by sharing the remaining car that you have, using public transportation and so on. Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home. Quit going out for meals no matter what, if it's just a salad or a fancy fancy dinner? Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home. You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table. Collins: Yes, there would be people who would argue with you about that, though, too, because our culture is just so socially oriented to food. Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch. Yeager: We're too busy to cook because we're too busy earning the money to spend it by dining out. Collins: Yes, yes. All right, you also say quit shopping for new clothes. Yeager: Yes. Here again, it's what's good for your pocketbook and good for the environment. Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out. The average family spends about $1,800 on clothing. Certainly most of us have more than enough stuff in our closet that we could go six months, even a year without buying new clothes. Collins: Yes, and then maybe just get it tailored or updated or something. Accessorize, I don't know, right? Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out. That's a waste of the Earth's resources. Collins: All right. And finally, give up college room and board. You want the kids to live at home forever? Yeager: This is a big one, you know? Back in my day, if you have a child in school, consider having them live at home while they go to school. It's been a huge generational shift. Back in my days, lots of people, including myself, lived at home when we went to college. Therefore, we didn't take out any college student loans. Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans. When they graduate, what do they do? They move back home with mom and dad! Let's skip the money step!"}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "London, England (CNN) -- Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup. Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give \"Les Bleus\" a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. \"I will be honest. It was a handball but I am not the referee,\" the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris. The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play. \"Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it. Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay,\" Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN. \"They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot. It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country. Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win.\" The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA. \"I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night,\" chief executive John Delaney told reporters. \"The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay.\" Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation. \"They need to look at themselves in this situation. Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy,\" he said. \"It is up to the people who govern the game now. Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity. This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward.\" The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain  for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty. \"The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected,\" the FAI said. FIFA confirmed it had received the Irish request for a replay, but gave no timescale on a decision. However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed. \"Law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final,\" it said. \"The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match.\" Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal. \"He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals,\" the defender said. \"FIFA will probably be happy. Yet again the big decisions have gone for the bigger team.\" Football's international governing body had faced criticism from several Irish players that the seeding system for the play-off draw favored more powerful nations such as France. Blog: When will FIFA see what's staring them in the face? Dunne's teammate Robbie Keane admitted it was \"hard to speak,\" as he struggled to come to terms with the result. \"With the way we played, we certainly deserved to win the game and it killed us near the end with that handball,\" he was quoted by the FAI Web site as saying. \"I've seen the replay but we knew anyway (it was handball). You could see by the reaction of the players, especially Shay (Given) who was two yards away from it. You don't get a reaction like that. It was a clear handball. \"He (Henry) almost caught the ball and actually ran into the net with it. We're devastated.\" Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry. \"It would not have been the first time a player would have asked and it would not have been out of turn. \"We are angry,\" the Italian continued. \"It is a bitter evening for me. I would prefer to have gone out on penalties.\" Fanzone: Five of football's most famous injustices . But former France international David Ginola was emphatic that Henry should not have \"owned up.\" \"You don't do that,\" he told CNN. \"Henry was doing his job. You can't blame him for doing everything he could for his team and country to get them to South Africa. \"But it was a shame to finish the game like that as Ireland had played very well. \"Referees need more help on the pitch, so as not to allow things like that. Obviously the referee was not well-positioned and couldn't see.\" English Referees Union chief Alan Leighton told CNN that Swedish official Martin Hansson had clearly missed a huge decision. \"I think the incident was more of instinct than deliberately attempting to cheat but it does seem that the ball hit his hand twice and therefore there is an issue.\" But on the wider issue of cheating, Leighton said: \"It is all very well to blame the referees for not spotting it but fundamentally it starts with the players. \"I think the players have to think about the game, think about the reputation of the game and their own reputations and say look actually there is a line that we will not cross.\""}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given news articles and you need to generate a highlight, i.e., a short summary, with a maximum length of 10 lines.", "input": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat. The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning, said Kamal Prasad Kharel, the police chief of the Baitadi district, an area about 600 kilometers (373 miles) west of Kathmandu. The grisly discovery, which came after teams of people searched for the child, marks the 15th victim in the past 15 months in that remote district in western Nepal. The police chief suspects that a single man-eating leopard is responsible for the deaths. If not, there are at most two of the man-eating creatures around, he believes. Maheshwor Dhakal, an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu, agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man-eating animals in one area. Most leopards live on wild prey. More human victims could also be expected if there were more than one or two man-eaters around, he said. \"Since human blood has more salt than animal blood, once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer,\" Dhakal said. Kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15, because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district. \"It could be the same leopard,\" he said. Of the 15 victims in Nepal so far, two-thirds are children below the age of 10. The others are older children and a 29-year-old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest, a common practice in Nepal. \"No adult male has been killed,\" Kharel said. All the victims are from villages bordering the dense forests in the district, he said. After killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat. \"In the case of the children it just leaves behind the head, eating everything, but some parts of the adult body are left behind because it cannot finish it,\" Kharel added. The district administration has announced a Rs. 25,000 (about $300) reward to anyone who captures or kills the leopard. The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilized the police, armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the animal. Controlling this particular leopard has been a challenge for the wildlife officials in Kathmandu. \"We are sending a veterinary doctor to the district to understand the situation,\" Dhakal, the ecologist, said. \"There is no alternative but to kill the leopard.\" The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed. Normally, it is illegal to kill wild animals. Leopards are common in the low mountain areas, as compared to the high Himalayas, across the country. While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common, and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal, this case is \"extreme,\" Dhakal said."}, {"instruction": "In this task you are given a passage in Bulgarian as the input content.

BC1 RNA, an ID-related transcript, is derived from the single copy BC1 RNA gene. The BC1 RNA gene has been shown to be a master gene for ID element amplification in rodent genomes. ID elements are dispersed through a process termed retroposition. The retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. These regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue, transcript stability, priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription and integration. This study focuses on priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription. BC1 RNA gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. This self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3'-unique region. The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a RNA capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the BC1 RNA gene as a master gene for amplification of ID elements."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Recent technological advances allow unbiased whole-genome DNA methylation (methylome) analysis to be carried out on human cells. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing at 24.7-fold coverage (12.3-fold per strand), we report a comprehensive (92.62%) methylome and analysis of the unique sequences in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the same Asian individual whose genome was deciphered in the YH project. PBMC constitute an important source for clinical blood tests world-wide. We found that 68.4% of CpG sites and <0.2% of non-CpG sites were methylated, demonstrating that non-CpG cytosine methylation is minor in human PBMC. Analysis of the PBMC methylome revealed a rich epigenomic landscape for 20 distinct genomic features, including regulatory, protein-coding, non-coding, RNA-coding, and repeat sequences. Integration of our methylome data with the YH genome sequence enabled a first comprehensive assessment of allele-specific methylation (ASM) between the two haploid methylomes of any individual and allowed the identification of 599 haploid differentially methylated regions (hDMRs) covering 287 genes. Of these, 76 genes had hDMRs within 2 kb of their transcriptional start sites of which >80% displayed allele-specific expression (ASE). These data demonstrate that ASM is a recurrent phenomenon and is highly correlated with ASE in human PBMCs. Together with recently reported similar studies, our study provides a comprehensive resource for future epigenomic research and confirms new sequencing technology as a paradigm for large-scale epigenomics studies."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Analysis of these cDNAs has enabled us to determine the entire structure of the human Golli-MBP gene. The Golli-MBP gene, which encompasses the MBP transcription unit, is approximately 179 kb in length and consists of 10 exons, seven of which constitute the MBP gene. The human Golli-MBP gene contains two transcription start sites, each of which gives rise to a family of alternatively spliced transcripts. At least two Golli-MBP transcripts, containing the first three exons of the gene and one or more MBP exons, are produced from the first transcription start site. The second family of transcripts contains only MBP exons and produces the well-known MBPs. In humans, RNA blot analysis revealed that Golli-MBP transcripts were expressed in fetal thymus, spleen, and human B-cell and macrophage cell lines, as well as in fetal spinal cord. These findings clearly link the expression of exons encoding the autoimmunogen/encephalitogen MBP in the central nervous system to cells and tissues of the immune system through normal expression of the Golli-MBP gene. They also establish that this genetic locus, which includes the MBP gene, is conserved among species, providing further evidence that the MBP transcription unit is an integral part of the Golli transcription unit and suggest that this structural arrangement is important for the genetic function and/or regulation of these genes."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

GSCs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. We determined that A20 (TNFAIP3), a regulator of cell survival and the NF-kappaB pathway, is overexpressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mRNA and protein levels. To determine the functional significance of A20 in GSCs, we targeted A20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Inhibiting A20 expression decreased GSC growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/RelA. Elevated levels of A20 in GSCs contributed to apoptotic resistance: GSCs were less susceptible to TNFalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but A20 knockdown sensitized GSCs to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The decreased survival of GSCs upon A20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. The tumorigenic potential of GSCs was decreased with A20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. In silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that A20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. Together these data indicate that A20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. Although inactivating mutations in A20 in lymphoma suggest A20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest A20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of GSC survival. A20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

In this study applied to infectious diseases, data from a microarray designed for molecular serotyping of Streptococcus pneumoniae was used, identifying the presence of any one of 91 known pneumococcal serotypes from DNA extracts. This microarray incorporated oligonucleotide probes for all known capsular polysaccharide synthesis genes and required a statistical analysis of the microarray intensity data to determine which serotype, or combination of serotypes, were present within a sample based on the combination of genes detected.   \n RESULTS We propose an empirical Bayesian model for calculating the probabilities of combinations of serotypes from the microarray data. The model takes into consideration the dependencies between serotypes, induced by genes they have in common, and by homologous genes which, although not identical, are similar to each other in sequence. For serotypes which are very similar in capsular gene composition, extra probes are included on the microarray, providing additional information which is integrated into the Bayesian model. For each serotype combination with high probability, a second model, a Bayesian random effects model is applied to determine the relative abundance of each serotype.   \n CONCLUSIONS To assess the accuracy of the proposed analysis we applied our methods to experimental data from samples containing individual serotypes and samples containing combinations of serotypes with known levels of abundance. All but two of the known serotypes of S. pneumoniae that were tested as individual samples could be uniquely determined by the Bayesian model. The model also enabled the presence of combinations of serotypes within samples to be determined. Serotypes with very low abundance within a combination of serotypes can be detected (down to 2% abundance in this study). As well as detecting the presence of serotype combinations, an approximate measure of the percentage abundance of the serotypes within the combination can be obtained."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the \u2018hat\u2019 matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

Synthetic TLR7 ligands induce the maturation of pDCs, as evidenced by the expression of costimulatory molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines; however, they induce only low-level production of IFN-alpha. To dissect the TLR7 signaling in pDCs and how these different profiles are induced, we studied the effects of 2 TLR7 ligands (Flu and CL097) on the activation of blood-isolated pDCs and the human GEN2.2 pDC cell line. Type I IFN production by pDCs correlates with differential interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) translocation into the nucleus induced by the 2 TLR7 ligands. Surprisingly, with both activators we nevertheless observed the rapid expression of the IFN-inducible genes mxa, cxcl10, and trail within 4 hours of stimulation. This expression, controlled by STAT1 phosphorylation, was independent of type I IFN. STAT1 activation was found to be strictly dependent on the PI3K-p38MAPK pathway, showing a new signaling pathway leading to rapid expression of IFN-inducible genes after TLR7 triggering. Thus, pDCs, through this unusual TLR7 signaling, have the capacity to promptly respond to viral infection during the early phases of the innate immune response."}, {"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

We assessed vasomotor function of the adipose microvasculature using videomicroscopy of small arterioles (75-250 \u03bcm) isolated from different fat compartments. Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was severely impaired in visceral arterioles, compared to the subcutaneous depot (P<0.001 by ANOVA). Nonendothelium dependent responses to papaverine and nitroprusside were similar. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibition with N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced subcutaneous vasodilation but had no effect on severely blunted visceral arteriolar responses. Visceral fat exhibited greater expression of proinflammatory, oxidative stress-related, hypoxia-induced, and proangiogenic genes; increased activated macrophage populations; and had a higher capacity for cytokine production ex vivo.   \n CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide clinical evidence that the visceral microenvironment may be intrinsically toxic to arterial health providing a potential mechanism by which visceral adiposity burden is linked to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Our findings also support the evolving concept that both adipose tissue quality and quantity may play significant roles in shaping cardiovascular phenotypes in human obesity."}, {"instruction": "You are given a passage.

This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \"Self Reliance,\" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \\nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the \"independence of solitude\"). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a \"finished man\" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced \"perfect sweetness\" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \\nWhat do you think?"}, {"instruction": "You are given a passage.
